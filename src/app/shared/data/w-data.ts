  blog: '<p><b>Will filing a claim under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act (CLJA) affect my VA benefits?</b></p><p>&nbsp;<span>This is by far the most common and concerning question that is called into our office by our veteran clients. &nbsp;We welcome the opportunity to set the record straight for all veterans and veteran service organizations (VSOs).&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>The answer is&nbsp;<strong>NO</strong>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>The Navy&apos;s Tort Claims Unit (TCU) has said on its official website relating to the CLJA claims that&nbsp;</span><b>"[c]laims filed with the TCU&nbsp;</b><b>do not</b><b>&nbsp;impact benefits or programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs."</b><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><i><span>Source:&nbsp;</span></i><a href=\"https://www.jag.navy.mil/organization/code_15_Camp_Lejeune_Claims.htm\"><span>https://www.jag.navy.mil/organization/code_15_Camp_Lejeune_Claims.htm</span></a><span>.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Similarly, the VA through a spokesperson has recently said in a Verify article that veterans&apos; CLJA claims&nbsp;</span><span>will not</span><span>&nbsp;have their VA benefits reduced because of any additional compensation from the CLJA.&nbsp; The spokesperson also said&nbsp;</span><b>"if a veteran is already receiving VA benefits as a result of disability related to contaminated water exposure at Camp Lejeune, their&nbsp;</b><b><i>court award</i></b><b>&nbsp;will be reduced by the value of those benefits."&nbsp;</b></p><p><i><span>Source:</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.11alive.com/article/news/verify/government-verify/camp-lejeune-justice-act-2022-honoring-our-pact-act-water-how-to-file-claim-fact-check/536-b1e0baef-193f-429e-8e0a-8faf7ad78cbd\"><span>https://www.11alive.com/article/news/verify/government-verify/camp-lejeune-justice-act-2022-honoring-our-pact-act-water-how-to-file-claim-fact-check/536-b1e0baef-193f-429e-8e0a-8faf7ad78cbd</span></a><span>)</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Notably, the spokesperson for the VA correctly stated that the veterans’&nbsp;</span><b><i>“court award”</i></b><span>&nbsp;may be reduced --&nbsp;</span><b><i>not the veterans’ VA benefits</i></b><span>. &nbsp;This means that only once an individual receives a court award can the government seek any potential reduction (offset) to the award for VA benefits that individual has received.&nbsp; The government could also presumably waive the offset entirely in negotiations.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>We believe the Navy’s and the VA’s positions are consistent and in line with the CLJA statute. &nbsp;We are aware of no examples of any governmental agency taking contrary positions.&nbsp; So far, we are only aware of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) nonprofit organization taking a seemingly different position in a recent VFW Magazine article, referenced below.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>The offset provision in the CLJA clearly states:</span></p><p><span>(2)&nbsp;</span><span>H</span><span>EALTH AND DISABILITY BENEFITS RELATING TO WATER EXPOSURE.—</span></p><p><span>Any&nbsp;</span><b><i>award</i></b><span>&nbsp;made to an individual, or legal representative of an individual, under this section shall be&nbsp;</span><b><i>offset</i></b><span>&nbsp;by the amount of any disability award, payment, or benefit provided to the individual, or legal representative—</span></p><p><span>(A) under—</span></p><p><span>(i) any program under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;</span></p><p><span>(ii) the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (</span><a href=\"http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=42&amp;section=1395\"><span>42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.</span></a><span>); or</span></p><p><span>(iii) the Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act (</span><a href=\"http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=42&amp;section=1396\"><span>42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.</span></a><span>); and</span></p><p><span>(B)&nbsp;</span><b><i>in connection with health care or a disability&nbsp;</i></b><b><i>relating to exposure to the water at Camp Lejeune</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p><p><i><span>(emphasis added)</span></i><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<i><span>See</span></i><span>&nbsp;Sect. 804(d)(2)&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3373/text\"><span>https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3373/text</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>We believe there are two key parts of this legislation directly relevant to this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<b>Only An Award Can Be Offset.</b><span>&nbsp; First, the law clearly states that only a CLJA&nbsp;</span><b><i>“award”</i></b><span>&nbsp;(</span><i><span>i.e.</span></i><span>, settlement, verdict, etc.) can be offset, i.e.&nbsp;</span><i><span>reduced,</span></i><span>&nbsp;by whatever “amount of any disability award, payment, or benefit ... provided to the individual ... under any [VA-administered program, Medicare, or Medicaid].”&nbsp; Black’s Law Dictionary defines “offset” simply as “a reduction.”&nbsp; Therefore, according to the plain language of the statute, only a&nbsp;</span><i><span>CLJA award</span></i><span>&nbsp;shall be reduced by the amount of VA/Medicare/Medicaid benefits that the government can prove are related to the harm caused by contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.&nbsp; The purpose of an offset is to prevent a double-recovery, where the government would have to pay a veteran twice for the same damages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<b>Only a CLJA-Related Benefit Is Subject to an Award Offset.</b><span>&nbsp; The second provision of importance&nbsp;</span><span>(sect. 804(d)(2)(B) highlighted above) clarifies that the veteran’s CLJA award could&nbsp;</span><i><span>only be reduced to the extent the veterans’ VA provided benefit was related to the same water-related illness</span></i><span>. For example, the government will have to prove that the VA benefit (e.g., health care or monthly disability benefits) was related to the veterans’ contaminated water disease/harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Example: If a veteran is on 100% disability for combat-related PTSD and a knee injury, but his/her CLJA award is for kidney cancer, the government would not be permitted to take any offset for monthly disability benefits from that veteran’s CLJA settlement because the government cannot prove the disability benefits are related to the harm caused by toxic water.&nbsp; There would be no “double recovery” for the veteran under those circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>In an opposite example, if a veteran is getting 100% disability for kidney cancer, and his/her CLJA award is also related to kidney cancer, then the statute states that the veteran’s CLJA&nbsp;</span><i><span>court award&nbsp;</span></i><span>may be reduced by the amount of benefits they have received from the VA for kidney cancer-related health care or disability.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<b><i>However, it is important to note that the reduction is only permitted</i></b>&nbsp;<b><i>up to</i></b>&nbsp;<b><i>the date of the claim&apos;s resolution because a reduction is only permitted on the award, not on VA benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b><span>Even under this scenario, where the VA benefits were provided for the proven CLJA-related harm, there is no indication that the benefits can or would be reduced on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; Only the court award or settlement – not future VA benefits - would be reduced by the previous VA benefits provided.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Key takeaways from this provision include:&nbsp;</span></p><span>-If you do not prevail in the case, your benefits will never be affected</span><span>-If you win your lawsuit and get a verdict or settlement from the U.S. Government,&nbsp;</span><i><span>only then</span></i><span>&nbsp;will the government be allowed a reduction of the award for already-provided VA benefits.&nbsp;</span><i><span>-But</span></i><span>&nbsp;in order to receive the reduction, the U.S. Government will have the burden of proving that the provided VA benefit was related to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.</span><span>-There is little likelihood, if any, that a veteran would receive&nbsp;</span><span>no settlement</span><span>&nbsp;after the government reductions, as that would be inequitable&nbsp;</span><i><span>and</span></i><span>&nbsp;a settlement that no veteran or civilian would likely accept after being exposed unknowingly to contaminated water and suffering a terrible harm, disease, or cancer. &nbsp;</span><span>-There is a reasonably likely possibility that the government – as a part of a settlement – could waive the government’s entitlement to an offset or reduction, due to the complexity of analyzing each individual case for a reduction and their burden to prove that the benefit was related to the disease/harm caused by contaminated water.</span><p><span>It is important to note that the Camp Lejeune Justice Act statute is very different from how a contaminated water claim was brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).&nbsp; Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1151, if a veteran is awarded any compensation from a FTCA claim related to the same injury/illness for which the veteran also receives VA benefits, the VA&nbsp;</span><i><span>can</span></i><span>&nbsp;suspend benefits until the full amount of the FTCA award is recovered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>The language that is present in the Federal Tort Claims Act statute is not present in the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022</span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i><span>Source:</span></i><span>&nbsp;38 U.S.C. § 1151 (b)(1);&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1151\"><span>https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1151</span></a><span>.&nbsp; The Camp Lejeune Justice Act allows an offset on the award and&nbsp;</span><span>not</span><span>&nbsp;a suspension of benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>In its recent Fall 2022 edition, VFW Magazine published an article and included quotations by VFW General Counsel John Muckelbauer causing veterans to believe that filing a claim under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act could potentially cause their VA benefits to stop or be suspended.&nbsp; VFW is a nonprofit veterans’ service organization (VSO).&nbsp; This nonprofit program has many members and has been wonderfully helpful and trusted to veterans for decades.&nbsp; However, it is not a governmental entity and is not involved with the administration of VA benefits nor is it the entity who is handling and/or litigating these claims on behalf of the United States (Department of Navy/Torts Claims Unit and Department of Justice (DOJ)).&nbsp; We have had conversations with Mr. Muckelbauer, who was kind enough to speak to us after the article was released, and we are continuing to work with the VFW and Mr. Muckelbauer to ensure that truthful and accurate information is circulated to veterans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Our firm encourages veterans to rely upon the plain language of the statute as well as the guidance which has been issued directly by the VA and Navy’s Tort Claims Unit which unequivocally states that claims filed under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act do not impact benefits or programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.&nbsp; Any offset, or reduction, would only be to a court award to prevent “double recovery,” and only for VA benefits which are proven to be related to the harm caused by the contaminated water and have been received prior to the date of the award.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>If you continue to have any questions about whether filing a claim under the CLJA will affect your past or future benefits, please do not hesitate to contact our firm by emailing&nbsp;</span><a href=\"mailto:justiceforcamplejeune@wallacegraham.com\"><span>justiceforcamplejeune@wallacegraham.com</span></a><span>&nbsp;or calling or texting Wallace &amp;

  blog: '<p><span>When you experience a</span><a href=\"http://www.autoaccident.com/personal-injury-damages-what-youre-able-to-recover.html\"> <span>personal injury</span></a><span> at the fault of another party, it can be life-altering. You might be faced with exorbitant medical bills, loss of income, and damage to your vehicle. In addition, if you experience disability as a result of your injury, you may soon realize that your loss of income will last much longer than just a few days or a few weeks. If you experienced any trauma as a result of your injury, you may need ongoing therapy or even inpatient services. If you lost your job, which is common following a serious injury, you may have lost access to benefits like health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, short-term disability, retirement savings, and more. In this blog post, we&apos;ll help you understand which damages you may be able to recover in North Carolina.</span></p><h2><span>Damages In Personal Injury Cases</span></h2><p><a href=\"http://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/types-of-compensation.html\"><span>Damages</span></a><span> vary greatly from one situation to another and will depend on the unique circumstances surrounding your personal injury. Some of the most common damages awarded to injured parties include:</span></p><ul><li><span>lost wages</span></li><li><span>loss of wages in the future, if you are unable to return to work</span></li><li><span>medical bills you&apos;ve incurred as a result of the injury or accident</span></li><li><span>the estimated cost of future medical bills</span></li><li><span>household expenses associated with your injury, such as modifications to the home to make it handicapped accessible</span></li><li><span>loss of companionship</span></li><li><span>mental anguish</span></li><li><span>pain and suffering</span></li><li><span>wrongful death, which can include compensation for funeral costs, burial expenses, medical care rendered before death, the emotional distress of loved ones, lost wages, and more</span></li></ul><p><span>In some cases, additional categories of compensation like property damage repairs and punitive damages may also apply. Punitive damages are extended with the intent of punishing the defendant for particularly egregious behavior (and may be used to set an example and deter others from engaging in similar behavior in the future). The exact damages that may apply in your case will depend on the specific details of your situation.&nbsp;</span></p><h2><span>Personal Injury Settlement Breakdown</span></h2><p><span>Common</span><a href=\"http://www.findlaw.com/injury/accident-injury-law/injury-damages.html\"> <span>personal injury cases</span></a><span> include workplace accidents, motor vehicle accidents, medical malpractice, wrongful death, premises liability, and product liability. If you suffered a personal injury and you think somebody else may have been at fault, you might be eligible for compensation that can assist you in recouping the expenses you&apos;ve incurred as a result of your injury. If your loved one was injured or killed as a result of any of the above, you - as their next of kin - may be eligible for compensation. The only way to know for sure is to reach out to a personal injury attorney to explore the possibility of filing a bodily injury claim.</span></p><h2><span>Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.</span></h2><p><span>Are you struggling to make ends meet after a personal injury or did you lose a loved one due to an injury or accident?

  blog: '<h1><span>Underinsured Motorist and Uninsured Motorist Coverage</span></h1><p><span>When dealing with vehicle insurance, many people don’t really understand the provisions for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. These are additions to the standard vehicle insurance policy, but it is often rejected because the coverage may be a little confusing. Once someone understands</span><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underinsured-motorist-coverage.asp\"> <span>what is underinsured motorist coverage</span></a><span>, they can be better poised to make the decision about whether it will be advantageous for them to have it. There are distinct differences between underinsured and uninsured motorist coverage. Uninsured provides protection in an accident and the driver at fault doesn’t have liability insurance. Underinsured motorist coverage provides assistance if the at-fault driver doesn’t have enough liability insurance to cover medical expenses.</span></p><h2><span>What Is Underinsured Motorist Coverage</span></h2><p><span>If you’re wondering</span><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/underinsured-motorist-coverage\"> <span>how does underinsured motorist coverage work,</span></a><span> it’s the part of the policy that will cover your damages if the other party is responsible and does not have adequate insurance. This insurance is also starting to be required in certain states, so it’s always a good idea to check with your insurance agent before attempting to reject it from your policy. There are two types of coverage under this umbrella: motorist bodily injury, and motorist property damage. It is not uncommon for drivers to not have this provision. If you carry this type of insurance, it works well because your bills will be paid after the accident, especially if you’re fighting to recoup your losses. After all, who wants to be in an accident they didn’t cause and can’t’ get everything fixed or medical bills attended to?</span></p><h2><span>Underinsured and Uninsured Motorist Coverage</span></h2><p><span>If you’re wondering</span><a href=\"https://www.allstate.com/tr/car-insurance/uninsured-motorist-coverage.aspx\"> <span>do I need uninsured motorist coverage</span></a><span>, check with your agent. Uninsured and underinsured coverage protects you from those motorists that do not have liability coverage. This really comes in handy if you are in a car accident with someone who does not have enough insurance to cover your costs. If you find yourself in an accident, knowing what to expect can give you peace of mind. Having an</span><a href=\"auto-checklist\"> <span>auto checklist</span></a><span> on hand that can give you a general idea of what to do when involved in an accident is key.</span></p><h2><span>Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>If you find yourself in a situation where you are dealing with a driver that does not have uninsured motorist or underinsured motorist coverage, one of the first things you should do is</span><a href=\"hiring-a-lawyer\"> <span>contact a personal injury attorney.</span></a><span> While many people don’t understand what a personal injury attorney really does</span><a href=\"the-basics-of-personal-injury-what-does-personal-injury-include/\"><span>, learning the basics</span></a><span> can give you peace of mind when faced with certain situations, like vehicle accidents that result in medical expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The team at Wallace &amp; Graham is ready and able to walk you through the process of dealing with a case where the person doesn’t have adequate insurance.

These questions and concerns are normal and expected, and we&apos;re here to help. In this blog post, we&apos;ll share what you need to know in the event you ever face this unfortunate circumstance - including how to prepare ahead of time, what to do right after the accident if you&apos;re able, and who to contact for help during the aftermath.</span></p><h2><span>North Carolina Uninsured Motorist Statute</span></h2><p><span>If you&apos;re involved in an accident without insurance in North Carolina, there are several things to consider:</span></p><ol><li><span>First, your own Uninsured Motorist Coverage or Underinsured Motorist Coverage will help cover the cost of any injuries sustained in the accident. Reach out to your insurance carrier for help submitting claims and navigating that process. If the other driver was insured but the coverage doesn&apos;t cover the cost of medical treatment for all passengers, Underinsured Motorist Coverage can help fill the gap.</span></li><li><span>If you have collision coverage on your own policy and the other driver was uninsured, your collision coverage will likely cover the cost of damages your vehicle sustained in the accident.</span></li><li><span>Finally, you can sue the</span><a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/the-other-driver-doesnt-have-car-insurance-now-what.html\"> <span>uninsured driver</span></a><span> for any damages not covered by other means, although collecting any judgment awarded can be challenging if assets are limited.</span></li></ol><h2><span>Uninsured Motorist Coverage North Carolina</span></h2><p><span>If you live in North Carolina,</span><a href=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/article/hit-uninsured-motorist-what-you-should-know\"> <span>uninsured motorist coverage</span></a><span> can help you prevent the unexpected costs associated with a serious injury accident with an uninsured motorist.

  blog: '<p><span><strong>Celebrating 40 Years Of PracticeBy: Mona Lisa Wallace</strong>Did you know that last year Wallace &amp; Graham celebrated its 40</span><span>th</span><span> year of business?&nbsp; Perhaps no one is more surprised than me.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 1981, I decided to open my own law firm against all odds:&nbsp; a </span><i><span>female</span></i><span> attorney, a </span><i><span>female </span></i><span>business owner, a </span><i><span>female </span></i><span>boss, who was in her 20s, in the early 1980s, in a small town, in the South.&nbsp; I knew that I had passion and fight.&nbsp; I knew how much I cared about helping people.&nbsp; I knew my work ethic would carry me through the toughest of times.&nbsp; I could have never predicted that 40 years later, I would be joined by 60 incredible attorneys and legal professionals, joined for 30 years by the same steadfast and brilliant business partner, Bill Graham, and for 14 years by my equally passionate daughter, Whitney Wallace Williams, and that our talented team would be holding some of the most powerful corporations in the world accountable for legal wrongdoings.</span><span>The David versus Goliath challenges began almost at the beginning. As early as 1982, our firm took up the fight to provide a safe working environment for workers.&nbsp; By 1983, I began representing workers exposed to asbestos and chemicals, new litigation for the industry.&nbsp; Our team has worked tirelessly for decades to achieve unique success in representing injured workers harmed by dangerous exposures.&nbsp; We have represented thousands of workers exposed to asbestos and dangerous chemicals, as well as thousands injured on the job.&nbsp; We demanded employers implement their own programs of medical monitoring.&nbsp; We help exposed clients with early detection and cancer screenings.&nbsp; In one year alone, our firm’s efforts resulted in the early detection of over 100 cancers, saving lives as a result.&nbsp;</span>W&amp;G attorneys, the late Mike Pross and Ed Pauley, devoted over 20 years to representing those injured by occupational diseases, influencing the law in the field.<span>Last year, my partner, Bill Graham, secured one of the largest verdicts in North Carolina history ($32.5 million) to help the family of a worker lost to mesothelioma, a rare cancer caused by asbestos exposure. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This work is something we are deeply proud of. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In addition to helping injured workers, the addition of the exceptionally talented attorney John Hughes to our firm in 2004, has enabled us to advance our civil department, taking on some of the largest corporate actors in consumer protection class actions and mass environmental actions in North Carolina history.&nbsp; We have represented countless victims of automobile accidents and corporate harm and countless families of those who lost a loved one due to the negligence of another, always going the extra mile to make sure all clients receive the maximum compensation possible for their injuries and harm.&nbsp; Over the years, as we have witnessed fraud, corporate unaccountability, discrimination, and greed, we have fought against it at every turn, achieving justice and securing some of the largest class action settlements and verdicts in the country.</span></p><p><span>In the last seven years, our biggest challenge has been our extended litigation battle against Smithfield Foods.&nbsp; Briefly, the facts are: Smithfield hires farmers to grow their hogs for them, dictating that the daily waste disposal method to dispose of thousands of hogs’ urine and feces is to pump the waste out of the barns into </span><i><span>multi-acre</span></i><span> open-air “lagoon” ponds full of waste.&nbsp; To prevent the waste ponds from overflowing, the waste is launched into the air with an industrial sprayer to “fertilize” surrounding fields next to our client&apos;s homes.&nbsp; Hog feces was detected in and on our clients’ houses and cars.&nbsp; Plumes of horrific feces odor could hit our clients’ homes at any unpredictable time, and there was nothing our clients could do about it.&nbsp; Our clients lost the use and enjoyment of their homes.&nbsp; Their basic property rights were assaulted.&nbsp; Many families – mostly African American - had inherited their land from ancestors dating back to Reconstruction, and nearly all the clients we helped were there </span><i><span>before</span></i><span> these operations moved in beside them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our firm underwent five federal jury trials against the largest hog producer in the world – Smithfield Foods – a Chinese-owned corporation.&nbsp; Despite massive publicity campaigns that distorted our fight and rallied the farm community against our cause and lawsuits, the verdicts came back in favor of our clients each time.&nbsp; 5 straight wins.&nbsp;&nbsp; The third verdict for 10 clients was $473 million, believed to be the largest verdict in N.C. history. &nbsp;The surprise twists and turns of our litigation, and the seemingly insurmountable odds we faced, were so unbelievable that our fight will soon be featured in a book, to be released in June 2022, by renowned author, Corban Addison, with a foreword by John Grisham, who stated:&nbsp;</span></p><p><i><span>Wastelands</span></i><i><span> . . . is the uplifting, round-by-round true story of a bunch of rural plaintiffs with no money and seemingly little hope, and the lawyers who smelled injustice and went to war on their behalf. . . . Never in my most creative moments could I have assembled such a colorful cast of characters, and then blessed them with so riveting a set of facts, and then guided them through the ins and outs and uncertainties of high-stakes litigation.&nbsp; Beautifully written, impeccably researched, and told with an air of suspense that few writers can handle, </span></i><i><span>Wastelands</span></i><i><span> is a story I wish I had written.</span></i></p><p><span>As a result of these trials, positive changes have been made by Smithfield, yet many more need to be made for the people in Eastern North Carolina to breathe clean air and drink clean water.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Countless important cases, against so many tremendous odds, have been handled to success by our firm.&nbsp; Suits against predatory lenders.&nbsp; Suits against car dealerships who cheated consumers.&nbsp; Suits against companies who denied employees vested pension benefits. Suits against companies with deceptive business practices. Suits against corporations who put profit over people.&nbsp; Suits against companies that defrauded the government. Suits against nursing homes who run their facility to the detriment of the elderly’s safety and health.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Currently, our law firm is devoted to exposing and inciting change in the health care billing industry.&nbsp;&nbsp; North Carolina has the highest drug and hospital prices of almost any other State.&nbsp; We have filed two lawsuits against large hospital chains alleging deceptive and unfair health care pricing, including an 87 page lawsuit against the country’s largest hospital chain, HCA.&nbsp; If we can effect change and promote across-the-board transparency and fairness in health care costs on a statewide or national basis, it may be the pinnacle of my career.</span></p><p><span>Our list of fights and cases changes weekly as we see the more unfair and unjust treatment of our clients and workers throughout the country.&nbsp; The cases I mentioned are just a few of thousands that we have taken on, and are committed to taking on, to force change for the better in our world.</span></p><p><span>Why do we work so hard?&nbsp; Why do we sometimes put the demands of our work over our own needs and even sometimes, ashamedly, over the needs of our own family?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Well, it’s because of you.&nbsp; Our clients.&nbsp; You are the heart of this firm.&nbsp; It is because of you that we wake up every morning and go to work, waiting on the next challenge we can face to make your lives better.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are the reason we love what we do.&nbsp; Your support and trust in us keep a fiery passion burning throughout our firm.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This 40-year journey has been a long one; there’s no denying that.&nbsp; But our daily interactions with our beloved clients are what keep us moving forward.&nbsp; I cannot express to you the joy myself and my team feels when we are able to win big for our clients. For that, I have to thank each and every one of you. Thank you for believing in us and trusting us with some of your most important matters.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>From the family, at Wallace and Graham, I would like to extend our most heartfelt thanks for you, and cheers to another forty years!</span></p><p><span>Sincerely yours,<img src=clientuploads/Blog_Images/MonaWallaceSig.png\" alt=\"signature" style=\"max-width: 250px;\"></span></p>'

  blog: '<p><span>To Whom This May Concern,</span></p><p><span>I, Haley Ramsey, RN, am officially giving my 2-week notice of resignation to the Mother-Baby Unit of Mission Health.</span></p><p><span>After spending 20 years of my life dedicated to the Mission Mother-Baby unit, I have come to the sad conclusion that this chapter of my life must end. I have prayed and sought out wise counsel from family, friends, and coworkers whom I love and trust. This has not been an easy decision for me as I know it will impact a lot of people whom I care about. I would like to share some background as to why I have made this decision. I apologize for the length.</span></p><p><span>I was hired onto the Mother-Baby Unit in June 2000 as a CNA during the last year of my nursing education. I was thrilled to have been hired and be an employee of Mission Hospital. It was once something to be proud of, and I was. My role consisted of many different tasks. I helped our nurses keep our unit organized and well-stocked. I was able to learn and help with tasks at the front desk such as answering phones, answering call bells, and breaking down charts. This is no easy task. Kudos to our extremely hard-working and multitasking unit secretaries. We couldn&apos;t make it without you! I was blessed with the opportunity to help with patients as well. The most exciting part for me was being able to help give baths and do hearing tests on our very newest and tiny patients, the babies. I gained an immense amount of knowledge and skills during that time. The nurses took me under their wings and exposed me to as many situations as they could while encouraging my learning during those last months of nursing school.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I was honored to take a registered nurse position back on my home unit, Mother-Baby in June of 2001. Within 6 months of being hired as a registered nurse on Mother Baby, I was being asked to take on the role of relief charge nurse and preceptor to other new employees of our unit. I felt honored to be entrusted with the care of our unit. I took my role seriously and wanted to be the best teacher and leader I could when placed in these roles.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Mission Hospital was once such a beacon for our community. I remember how involved the staff was in volunteer work and fundraising for the March of Dimes. I remember the days when they had big events like The Ducky Derby held at the Asheville Malls supporting our NICU babies. I remember having bake sales and volunteer days at local community outreach centers such as the Manna Food Bank. The hospital held special appreciation lunch events for the staff that were quite lovely with food, music, and token appreciation gifts. My co-workers and I truly felt cared for by the hospital management and the community. We were a community.</span></p><p><span>I am someone who takes pride in the cleanliness of my space whether that be at home or at work. I was always so impressed with how clean and nice our hospital was. We were blessed to have the equipment replaced when needed and in a timely manner. The rooms, hallways, nursing stations, and lounge areas were always comfortable and clean. I gave birth to each of my children at Mission and never had to worry about the cleanliness of any of my rooms. I knew that the hospital was always aiming to better itself. We were able to confidently give good care, in a clean, and comfortable environment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I was proud to be an employee of Mission Hospital, and knew that when I needed to take some time away to be with my third child, as my husband and I adjusted to being outnumbered, that I would be able to return with open arms to my second home, the Mother-Baby Unit. I returned in February of 2007. It was hard to be away from my family at home, but good to be back with an amazing work family that supported me through the transition. I quickly jumped right back in and was able to use the gifts that God has blessed me with as I cared for our new mamas and babies of WNC.</span></p><p><span>I can&apos;t deny that society has been changing, the economy has been changing, politics are changing and therefore healthcare is changing. Mission has not been able to escape this. I know that medical professionals all over the country have experienced this over the past several years, but to experience a nonprofit hospital being taken over by an enormous money-making corporation has been devastating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Mission Health was previously a nonprofit community hospital. Today it is a for-profit hospital making the HCA corporation a lot of money. How does a business make money one might ask? Well, you cut costs at the bottom so you have more profit at the top. I learned this very simple concept in a business class that I took a few years ago as my husband and I started our own small business. HCA is doing this very thing, and to an extreme. This corporation has employees literally making 10&apos;s of millions of dollars a year, while the employees that do the actual physical and mental work caring for patients are experiencing cuts like never before. The nursing staff was promised at the very beginning of this take over that our nurse-to-patient ratios would not change. That remained true for only about 3 months.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>HCA started by taking our support staff. Our unit secretaries were removed from the units and we were told that they were being helped to find new jobs. Our CNA&apos;s were either moved to other areas of the hospital, let go or placed in the secretary position so they could now take on both the role of the secretary and nursing assistant. For our Mother-Baby Unit that meant we took one person off of the floor that played a vital role in giving smooth and timely care to our patients. Our unit requires having a secretary at the desk at all times as their role is a very busy one. Letting patients and visitors in and out of our locked unit, answering phone calls, answering call bells for 34 rooms, making charts for all of our new patients, breaking down charts for all of our discharged patients, retrieving items from our tube system, making sure the right nurse receives the items sent, sending off important lab work to the state, entering information into our computer system, and answering the questions of countless people approaching the front desk as the secretary is the first smiling face you see as you enter our unit. These are just some of the extremely important tasks our secretaries are responsible for. So unfortunately now, our CNA&apos;s can no longer do the many important and time-consuming tasks they previously helped with on our unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our CNA’s helped us bathe our tiny newborn patients, draw labs, and helped watch them when a mother or family member was unable to. They helped mothers to the restroom, set up rooms for new patients, stocked the unit with necessary equipment, they wheeled patients out to their cars at the time of discharge, and helped with many other tasks. Not having their vital support has definitely added strain to the workload of our nurses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In May of 2019, I noticed that our staffing grid had changed. I am frequently placed in the relief charge nurse position, so I am responsible for making the assignments on days that I am in this role. The grid decreased the number of nursing staff allowed for the number of patients on the unit. Staffing has been made into a numbers game. Unfortunately, assigning nurses to care for patients is not something that can simply be determined by the number of patients you have. Patients have unique care needs and their acuity must be taken into consideration as you determine the number of nurses needed to safely care for the unit. Our core staffing numbers decreased, so keep in mind that we don&apos;t even schedule enough nurses to adequately staff our unit when we are full. We used to care for no more than 6 patients at a time. In recent days our nurses are caring for as many as 10 patients at a time. This is absolutely unsafe and has led to our nurses and unit staff feeling burnt out and defeated. We are taking on heavier patient loads, have less support staff, and have new tasks regularly being added to our list of things to do. So, as you would probably expect, our nurses are tired and don’t want to work at Mission anymore. Nurses are quitting, and we have fewer and fewer nurses to staff our unit. The Mother-Baby Unit has experienced a loss of over 18 nurses in a span of about 6 months.</span></p><p><span>Not only is the nursing staff suffering. It appears the ancillary staff throughout the hospital are suffering as well. The hospital has never been as filthy and unkempt as it is now. Trash runs over and onto the floors in the patient rooms, nurses&apos; stations, and lounges. Hazardous materials disposal containers have IV fluid bags and tubing pouring out into the medication room floor. Laundry bags pile up and run over onto the floors of our soiled utility rooms. Meal trays are constantly left behind in the patient rooms. Sinks and toilets aren&apos;t being kept clean, and most concerning leftover items from previous patients are being left in "clean" rooms and baby bassinets. So, why is this? Every time I ask what is going on I receive the same response "We are short staffed. We are doing the best we can." I know this is true and very unfortunate. Yet again, guess who gets to pick up the slack and take out the trays, empty the trash, and reclean the baby bassinets? The already overstretched and overly stressed nursing staff try to make sure that our patients don&apos;t directly feel the impact of this disaster, and we do it ourselves.</span></p><p><span>The nursing staff was approached by the Union shortly after HCA bought Mission Hospitals. Obviously, the nurses were seeking an answer, some support, or a way to turn things back around. I personally have felt skeptical about joining the union, because I felt it would take away from my being able to speak for myself and to have a direct relationship with my manager, whom I respect. I did not vote for the Union even though I knew there was a major need for change. I was hopeful that this could happen without such chaos and division. Regardless of my feelings, the nursing staff of Mission Health voted in the Union. The contract that has been agreed upon between HCA and the Union did not pan out well for some of the PRN staff that have dedicated many years to Mission.</span></p><p><span>Approximately 4 weeks ago I was contacted by my manager who gave me some bad news. She informed me that the PRN payment model was being changed and I needed to make a decision about which of the new tiers I wanted to commit to. I was told that a decision was needed that day. I do want to say that my manager did approach me with compassion and care about the situation. This did seem to be out of her hands. She gave me the facts that were available, but it was very difficult for me to understand as I had so many questions, and there were so few answers available.&nbsp; It was a lose-lose situation for me. None of the new tier levels came close to reaching my base pay rate let alone my previous incentive pay of 20%. My best case scenario was a loss of 20% and my worst case scenario was a loss of 32% of my wages. Over a three-week period of time, I was approached 3 times with different information and was asked to make a decision over the phone about what tier I wanted to commit to. The second conversation was brought to me as good news and they found a way for PRN staff to be able to keep our pay. I was first informed that if I became a tier 1 PRN employee I would be able to keep my current pay rate. The following week I was contacted by my supervisor and told that I would actually have to commit to a tier 2 to keep my current rate. The new tier model does not equally reflect the hours and commitment to the previous percentage model. I was also informed that if I chose a lower tier that I would be taken back to the new PRN tier payment model losing my 20% and my previous base pay. If this all sounds confusing it&apos;s because it is confusing. Ultimately, the new tier 2 is a greater commitment than the previous commitment that I had made to receive the 20% incentive. I am unable and unwilling to commit to the new Tier 2. I also find it insulting that a new graduate and a nurse with 20 years experience are placed under the same payment model. We would be making the same wage. This is a win for the new graduate, but a devastating loss to me, a nurse, who has dedicated her whole adult life, and experience to one unit.</span></p><p><span>I understand and accept that my not being willing to commit to this new model will cause me to lose my previous 20% incentive. However, I do not accept nor do I understand the hospital being able to take away from the base pay that I have earned over the past 14+ years. I called and spoke to Mother-Baby Unit&apos;s human resources representative and her supervisor. They confirmed the information that was given to me by my supervisor and manager. I questioned how they could take away from my base pay rate as this consists of my cost of living raises and 3 MERIT raises that I had earned over the past 14 years. The response I received is that "this is a new model." I asked our representative why this was&nbsp; happening and was informed that because of the new union contract "the money had to come from somewhere." I tearfully responded " so, I am being punished for a contract that I didn&apos;t even vote for?" and the human resource supervisor responded back to me "in theory, yes."</span></p><p><span>My pay rate has already been cut by 30.01% per my Lawson pay rate history as of July 17, 2021. This rate change occurred in the middle of a schedule that I signed up for while making my previous rate. The new commitment that I made to the hospital only requires me to sign up for 1 day every 60 days. I have worked 4 shifts since my pay rate was changed and have more than fulfilled my new commitment. I do not believe that I should be held accountable for the shifts that were committed to under a different agreement. I am especially upset about this because the hospital is offering any staff that works extra shifts an incentive of an extra $30/hr over their base pay rate. This includes housekeeping, dietary, and to my understanding anyone working in the patient care areas. I am making less money than any staff member receiving that incentive. I have been told that I am not eligible for this incentive as I am already on the schedule. I have asked for clarification and help with this matter and received no response. My last attempt was a phone call to the human resource supervisor on Thursday, August 12, 2021. I left a detailed message with my concerns and have not been contacted back.</span></p><p><span>I am a real person. I am a wife, a mama of 7, a soon-to-be grandmother, a friend, and I have been a loyal employee and nurse of Mission Health&apos;s Mother-Baby Unit for 20 of my 41 years of life. I was one of three nurses from Mission Hospitals that was honored as one of the Great 100 Nurses of NC in 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I have never been so disrespected or unappreciated in all of my working career as I have been in the past month. I am no longer willing to put my license, my reputation, or my physical and mental health on the line for a company that does not care about it&apos;s employees or the community it claims to serve.</span></p><p><span>I am truly sad to be leaving my unit. I know my fellow coworkers and work-family are hurting as they work through the most trying times we have ever experienced. To each of you, I am so very sorry.</span></p><p><span>I am praying for all of the staff of Mission Health. I am also praying for the community served by Mission Health. HCA is not who we are.</span></p><p><span>Sincerely,</span></p><p><span>Haley Ramsey RN</span></p>'

  blog: '<p>If you were hurt at work, you should file a workers’ compensation claim. However, how do you know if you even have a case? What if your worker&apos;s comp case is denied? Do I have a personal injury claim instead? What if I don’t like the worker&apos;s comp judge decision? All of these are important questions that you should ask yourself prior to filing an <a href=\"injured-at-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/injured-at-work\">NC workers comp claim</a>.</p><h2>Determining Whether You Have a Case</h2><p>If you were hurt on the job, the first thing you should do is get medical attention. Everything else can come after that. That also gives you time to document what happened, as you will need to provide a statement of your injuries to the workers’ compensation board or your worker&apos;s compensation attorney. Writing down your statement helps you remember everything that happened, and you have a couple of days to do this.</p><p>In a nutshell, if you have a personal injury claim, someone is at fault for your injuries. With a <a href=\"how-does-worker-s-compensation-work/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/how-does-worker-s-compensation-work/\">workers’ comp claim</a>, you do not have to show fault – you just need to show that you were injured on the job. Even if you were injured through your own negligence, you could apply for workers’ compensation.</p><p>If you believe you have a <a href=\"https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/workers-compensation/difference-personal-injury-claim.html" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/workers-compensation/difference-personal-injury-claim.html\">personal injury case</a>, you have to prove someone was at fault for the accident. For example, if you slip and fall on a dry walkway that is in excellent condition on your way from one building to another, no one is at fault for the accident. If the same walkway, which is a high travel area for employees, is iced over or is uneven, you might prove that your employer was at fault for the accident because it did not maintain the walkway.</p><h2>Workers Comp Denied Claim</h2><p>If you believe you are entitled to a <a href=\"four-types-of-workers-compensation-benefits-and-how-they-are-paid/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/four-types-of-workers-compensation-benefits-and-how-they-are-paid/\">workers comp settlement</a>, but your claim is denied, or you believe that the settlement is not a fair settlement, even when based on the worker&apos;s comp settlement chart, you have alternative options.</p><h3>When Will Workers Comp Offer a Settlement?</h3><p>Your employer’s workers’ compensation insurance will only <a href=\"do-you-get-a-settlement-from-workers-compensation/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/do-you-get-a-settlement-from-workers-compensation/\">offer a settlement</a> if you can show that you were injured at work and if your injuries prevent you from working. The insurance company could award a settlement but can also take it away if they find out that you are not really hurt.</p><p>To prevent this from happening, always seek medical attention immediately after an incident, make sure you keep follow-up appointments, and follow your doctor’s orders.</p><h3>What if I Don’t Agree with the Workers’ Comp Judge Decision?</h3><p>If you do not believe that the <a href=\"https://www.embroker.com/blog/workers-comp-settlement/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.embroker.com/blog/workers-comp-settlement/\">workers’ compensation judge made a fair decision</a>, you can retain a workers’ compensation attorney to help you appeal the decision. You also have the option to file a lawsuit against your employer and/or its workers’ compensation insurance.</p><p>People often try to get a settlement first since the courts could rule that you should get less than what a court might order. However, if you have injuries that are expected to turn into <a href=\"https://www.halt.org/get-what-youre-due-10-serious-signs-you-need-a-workers-comp-attorney/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.halt.org/get-what-youre-due-10-serious-signs-you-need-a-workers-comp-attorney/\">long-term or permanent disabilities</a> and the workers’ comp insurance refuses to settle for enough compensation to cover them, you can attempt to litigate your claim.</p><h2>When I Should Hire a Workers’ Comp Attorney</h2><p>Many people try to settle their workers’ compensation claims during the first phase themselves. However, an NC workers’ comp attorney can help you through that claim and will already have the facts ready if you should have to <a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-to-expect-at-your-workers-compensation-hearing.html" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-to-expect-at-your-workers-compensation-hearing.html\">file an appeal or litigate your claim</a>.

Immediately after you are injured, seek medical attention, then, as soon as possible contact a personal injury attorney.</p><h2>What to Expect When Meeting Your Lawyer</h2><p>When meeting with your lawyer for the first time, expect to discuss your case in detail. At first, your lawyer will be asking the questions, but you should also have questions. Before your appointment, write down <a href=\"questions-to-ask" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/questions-to-ask\">questions to ask your lawyer during a consultation</a>. The answers to the questions open up a two-way conversation that helps you determine whether your personalities will get along or clash.</p><p>You can also determine if your lawyer is qualified to handle your case. Not all personal injury lawyers are familiar with all areas of personal injury. For example, not all personal injury lawyers handle wage and hour discrimination cases. You’ll want an <a href=\"how-to-choose-a-personal-injury-lawyer" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/how-to-choose-a-personal-injury-lawyer\">attorney who is very familiar</a> with those laws, not one who is just starting out.</p><h2>What to Bring When Meeting Your Lawyer</h2><p>You should bring any relevant documents and a notebook to take notes. If you were served with a lawsuit, be sure to review the lawsuit carefully, and bring it with you. If you have a way to make copies, make yourself a copy – you’ll need to give the original to the attorney.</p><p>Other items you should bring:</p><ul><li><p>If your attorney gave you an initial consultation sheet to fill out, fill it out to the best of your abilities and bring it with you. Make sure your writing is neat and legible. The initial consultation sheet is often used to prepare the basis for a lawsuit or settlement negotiations if it has questions about the incident.</p></li><li><p>If you have any evidence, such as a police report from a car accident, or any medical records, bring those with you.</p></li><li><p>If you are meeting a personal injury lawyer, you <a href=\"https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/what-to-expect-when-meeting-your-attorney-for-the-first-time-35139" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/what-to-expect-when-meeting-your-attorney-for-the-first-time-35139\">don’t need to worry about payment</a>. The initial consultation is free, and most personal injury lawyers, including Wallace &amp; Graham, represent you on a contingency basis – that means the lawyer doesn’t get paid unless you win.</p></li><li><p>An outline of the facts of the case. This will help ensure that you don’t forget to discuss any important points, and will also help you answer the questions your lawyer will have for you. An outline also helps you fill out the initial consultation sheet.</p></li></ul><h2>What to Wear When Meeting Your Lawyer</h2><p>Always wear respectable clothing when meeting your lawyer. You should dress as if you were going to appear in court or as if you were going to work in an office. If all you have is jeans, they are fine as long as they are not stained (some jobs stain every piece of clothing you have), a nice top, and appropriate shoes. Even sneakers are fine, as long as they are clean.</p><p>Your lawyer will want to know if you can represent yourself appropriately should you have to go to court. The manner in which you dress goes a long way toward showing your credibility, especially in a courtroom.</p><h2>The Initial Consultation</h2><p>Always get everything ready the day before the <a href=\"https://www.utahbar.org/public-services/meeting-your-lawyer/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.utahbar.org/public-services/meeting-your-lawyer/\">consultation</a>. Leave 15 or 20 minutes early. If you are late, not only do you throw the attorney’s schedule off, but it could cause you to have less time with the attorney if he or she must leave the office for a court appointment, depositions, arbitration, or another meeting with third parties.</p><p>When you get to the office, you’ll have a few minutes to read over your notes to add anything you thought of after you initially made your notes, and refresh your memory of the points you need to discuss.</p><p>Contact a personal injury lawyer at <a href=\"contact-us" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/contact-us\">Wallace &amp; Graham</a> as soon after an accident as possible. Even if you are still in the hospital, you should contact your attorney. If you want too long, you could run out of time to attempt a settlement prior to having to file a lawsuit, and you could forget some of the facts that are pertinent in representing you to the best of the attorney’s ability.</p>'

  date: 'Tuesday, July 13, 2021',
  author: 'Wallace &amp; Graham, P.A.',
  tag: 'Personal Injury &amp; Wrongful Death',
  blog: '<p>When a product injures someone, the Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends that the company recall the dangerous product. However, in this case, Peloton refused to recall their Tread+ treadmill after dozens of children suffered injuries and one six-year-old child died from injuries after being sucked under the track.</p><p>The company eventually agreed that it should recall the Tread+ and its other treadmill, the Peloton Tread treadmill. However, the Peloton Tread was not the subject of the recall because of the track – that one was recalled because the touchscreen could fall off.</p><h2>The Peloton Recall for the Tread+</h2><p>The Tread+ with a model number of TR01 features a 67-inch running deck space with a 32-inch high-definition touchscreen. The belt is a slatted belt instead of the one-piece belt found on most treadmills. The Peloton Tread has a one-piece belt and, thus far, has not posed a danger to users, children or pets.</p><p>If you have the Peloton Tread+ with model number TR01, the company recommends that you stop using it and contact it for a full refund. You have until Nov. 6, 2022, to get a full refund. If you submit your claim after that date, you will get a partial refund. Your other option is to accept Peloton&apos;s offer of having someone move the treadmill to a room where children and pets do not have access. The peloton will provide this service for free.</p><h2>Treadmill Injuries Leading to the Recall</h2><p>According to the recall information, Peloton received 72 reports of children, pets, and adults being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. Those reports include 29 reports of injuries to children. The children suffered broken bones, lacerations, and second-and third-degree abrasions.</p><p>The unit was sold between Sept. 2018 and Apr. 2021 at Peloton showrooms and onepeloton.com.</p><h2>Recoverable Damages</h2><p>Those injured or who lost a loved one in product liability cases can recover damages. Depending on your circumstances, you could recover economic damages, including lost wages, medical expenses, and funeral, burial, and/or cremation expenses. Depending on the severity of your injuries, you might recover non-economic damages. If you lost a loved one, you could also recover economic and non-economic damages.</p><p>Injuries could include abrasions, broken bones, face, and eye injuries, amputation of a digit or limb, or death. If doctors expect any of these injuries to cause long-term or permanent disabilities, you could also recover future medical expenses and lost wages.</p><p>While the money does not bring back a loved one, it does reduce the financial stress of having less income coming into the household. Non-economic damages include:</p><ul><li>Pain and suffering, including emotional distress.</li><li>Loss of companionship and/or consortium.</li><li>Loss of quality of life.</li><li>Loss of use of a body part or bodily function.</li><li>Inconvenience.</li></ul><p>If you also suffer from anxiety or depression because the Peloton Tread+ caused injuries or death to a child or a pet, you could recover medical expenses for the costs of cognitive and/or other psychological therapies. You can also recover expenses for physical therapy and occupational therapy if your injuries caused extensive damage that requires one or both types of therapy.</p><p>If you or a loved one suffered injuries, or you lost a loved one because of the Peloton Tread+, contact Wallace &amp; Graham for a free case evaluation.</p>'

Bayer inherited the business and the litigation as part of a $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto in 2018.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">The company has said that decades of studies have shown Roundup and glyphosate are safe for human use.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Wednesday’s settlement would cover future claims brought by individuals who have been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and were exposed to Roundup before their diagnosis. The settlement also includes benefits for people who were exposed to Roundup and develop the cancer in the future.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Roundup, which Monsanto first brought to the market in 1974, is widely used by farmers across the United States and Brazil, alongside crops that are genetically engineered to withstand the its herbicidal effect.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Glyphosate will remain on the market. Bayer agreed to seek permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to provide a reference link on labels so consumers can find scientific studies on the weedkiller.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Under the proposed plan, Bayer will provide $2 billion for a four-year period as compensation and to cover outreach and diagnostic assistance. Future claimants could receive up to $200,000 under the deal.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">The parties can agree to extend the settlement period.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">The company said the settlement amount was disclosed last year.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">The agreement must be approved by U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Chhabria in June questioned the legality of a prior settlement plan that Bayer proposed, which envisioned creating a panel of scientists who would rule on the viability of claims.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Under the revised deal, anyone who does not make a claim during the four-year period would then be able to sue in court, according Elizabeth Cabraser, an attorney for the proposed class. She also said anyone diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma who does not like their compensation offer under the class plan can go to the court system and try for a better result.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">In June, Bayer reached a wider $9.6 billion settlement that would resolve the bulk of the more than 100,000 U.S. lawsuits that were already filed over Roundup.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Bayer’s stock has been battered by the litigation, but also by billions of euros in writedowns, and a bleaker profit outlook, in large part related to the $63 billion Monsanto takeover.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">The group last year announced 9.25 billion euros in impairment charges on agricultural assets and shocked markets by predicting a slight decline in core earnings per share in 2021 on weaker demand by farmers.</p>'

  blog: '<p>November 19, 2020</p><p>Fourth Circuit Affirms Smithfield Subsidiary Willfully and Wantonly Interfered With Neighbors’ Property Rights Today, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit affirmed that a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, Murphy-Brown LLC, is liable for compensatory and punitive damages to neighbors of a hog farm it controlled. In a 67-page opinion, the Court methodically addressed each of the seven issues Murphy-Brown raised, rejecting nearly all of them. The Court rejected MurphyBrown’s assertions that hog farmers were at fault, and not Murphy-Brown, as well as assertions that recent legislation applied to forbid pending litigation. The Court also rejected arguments that the testimony of a plaintiff expert witness was improperly admitted and the testimony of a defendant expert was improperly excluded. Regarding punitive damages, the Court recognized that the plaintiffs “provided evidence of [Murphy-Brown’s] deliberate corporate policies and evidence that [Murphy-Brown] knew these policies had associated harms.” There was “abundant evidence supporting [Murphy-Brown’s] conscious disregard of the conditions at Kinlaw Farms.” And Murphy-Brown’s “leadership persisted in mandating the culpable practices and participated in political efforts aimed at minimizing regulation of harms known to be associated with [MurphyBrown’s] chosen farming efforts.” The Court acknowledges that while there was ample evidence of Murphy-Brown’s willful misconduct justifying punitive damages, the district court should have limited the applicability of evidence regarding Smithfield’s financial status and remanded the case for new proceedings solely on the amount of punitive damages that should be awarded.</p><p>In his concurrence, Judge Wilkinson discussed how the hog farming industry is vital but required “responsible stewardship” to “account for [the] full impact on all stakeholders.” “Stakeholders do not just include consumers, suppliers, and employees; they include neighbors of hog facilities, children who go to school nearby, medical patients who rely on antibiotics, wildlife and water sports enthusiasts, and many more.”</p><p>Lead appellate counsel, Tillman J. Breckenridge of Breckenridge PLLC stated that he was pleased that “the Court of Appeals recognized that the jury was right – Smithfield willfully and wantonly interfered with our clients’ ability to live comfortably in their own homes.” He added that the decision “vindicates the hard work of the trial team, as the Court rebuked Smithfield and MurphyBrown’s practices.” Mona Lisa Wallace added that “we are thrilled at the positive outcome for our clients and the environment. We are especially glad that the Fourth Circuit recognized that the North Carolina jury got it right.” Lisa Blue noted that “we had faith in the jury systems and in the wonderful jurors who dedicated many weeks to understanding the plight of these North Carolina citizens and we’re delighted to see the jurors’ thoughtful consideration and decisions upheld.” Lead trial lawyer, Mike Kaeske further added: “I’m honored to have represented the most worthy group of clients of my career, and I’m grateful that the Court has so fully recognized the truth of their struggle.”</p><p>For the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal’s full opinion, click here:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;" href=\"https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/191019.P.pdf" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/191019.P.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605977499595000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyuFRdypvKRk0O-R-QSw4ZjT7TqA\">https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/<wbr>opinions/191019.P.pdf</a></span></p>'

Military families’ pleas to Congress and governmental agencies resulted in the nonprofit MFAN (Military Family Advisory Network) releasing a report reflecting that over 67% of all Fort Bragg families surveyed reported manifest effects from maintenance, repairs, and mediation.&nbsp; Heads of the Corvias admitted to Congress in 2019, under oath, its responsibility for unacceptable conditions.&nbsp; The complaint requests retrospective relief for the harms suffered by military service members and their families.&nbsp; The complaint requests class action designation.</span></p><p><span>Our complaint details numerous defective housing conditions suffered by our clients, including but not limited to the following:</span></p><ul class=\"list\"><li><span>Issues with mold and wood rot;</span></li><li><span>The lack of effective moisture and air barriers between exterior cladding and wall cavities;</span></li><li><span>Complaints of water damage in children’s bedrooms;</span></li><li><span>Complaints of leaking from the top of the home through interior walls;</span></li><li><span>Evidence of roof rot;</span></li><li><span>Evidence of ant infestation;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>HVAC system failure;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Cracking in walls and ceilings;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Black mold and structural wood rot found following an odor in a child’s bedroom;</span></li><li><span>Lead-based paint which poses a threat to children;</span></li><li><span>Filthy carpets with nails sticking out from under it;</span></li><li><span>Nonfunctioning electrical sockets;</span></li><li><span>Numerous issues associated with plumbing and leaks;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Sagging roofs, resulting in roof collapse;</span></li><li><span>Sagging interior floors, due to water damage;</span></li><li><span>Window frames damp to the touch and rotted with visible mold;</span></li><li><span>Issues with dry wall being water-permeable and not moisture rated;</span></li><li><span>Observable light through door seals due to improper fitting, which allowed both water and bugs access into the home;</span></li><li><span>Roof leaks and soft ceilings;</span></li><li><span>Evidence of defective repairs and patches in response to complaints;</span></li><li><span>Mold and mildew resulted in permanent odors to clothing;</span></li><li><span>Layers of linoleum flooring, revealing each layer covered with hidden mold;</span></li><li><span>Heating element on a family’s dishwasher caught fire and smoked;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Defective carbon monoxide detectors in units; and</span></li><li><span>A carbon monoxide leak resulting in physical harm to a military family, including severe fatigue, headaches, memory loss, congestion, gastrointestinal issues, and respiratory distress and harm to the child’s minor child resulting in severe headaches, runny nose, and “blue” inside of her nose.</span></li></ul><p><span>Our complaint alleges evidence of Corvias’ efforts to: conceal reported harmful environment and structural housing defects in all of the homes; direct shoddy repairs to cut costs; direct maintenance workers and vendors to conceal defects and not disclose defects to tenants; and direct the same not to use words such as “mold” around tenants.&nbsp; Corvias work orders disguised complaints and inaccurately downplayed reported and observed defects.&nbsp; Corvias asked residents to overlook defects on numerous occasions.&nbsp; In one disturbing example, when a family complained of lead paint and lead piping, Corvias advised the residents not to drink their tap water and not to let their toddler “eat paint chips.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Most tenants used the entirety of their housing allowance to afford the inadequate units, and many were forced to use low military salaries pay for their own repairs.</span></p><p><span>Our firm seeks a jury trial to address numerous issues including whether Corvias breached numerous housing statutes; concealed material facts and information about the units to residents; colluded and conspired to evade their repair and maintenance obligations by labeling housing defects as “wear and tear;” overcharged Plaintiffs for repair and maintenance items; used unfair and deceptive practices; and whether class members incurred substantial and unreasonable loss of use and enjoyment of their leaseholds of their homes, rising to the level of breach of the warranty of habitability, or, temporary recurrent private nuisance, for which they should be entitled to a refund reflecting the diminished rental value of the units during the class period as a result.</span></p><p></p>'

The firm’s clients had deep roots in their rural communities, only to have their lives changed when factory farms were built within feet of their homes.&nbsp; Smithfield directed farms to use a waste disposal system which consisted of hog urine and feces dropping beneath slats on the floors and tunneling into open-air lagoons which were up to three acres large.&nbsp; To prevent flooding of the lagoon, the waste was frequently sprayed into the air as a fertilizer. The lawsuit alleged neighbors suffered from things that no property owner should have to endure – horrible odor, clouds of flies, buzzards circling, trucks leaking filth and waking them up in the middle of the night, and children being teased for smelling like hogs. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Five separate three- to four-week trials took place in 2018 and 2019, with each eastern North Carolina jury unanimously returning verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs totaling more than $500 million, including the largest verdict in North Carolina history.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=\"p4\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The plaintiffs faced many obstacles along the way, including new legislation which would have effectively granted retroactive immunity to Smithfield from these suits, and organized hog rallies blocks from the courthouse steps.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Accepting the award on behalf of the firm, Mona Lisa Wallace emphasized the bravery of her clients to fight for change and the courage of the testifying witnesses and experts, such as Harnett County hog farmer Tom Butler who testified in each trial that there were economically feasible alternatives that eliminated the harm to nearby neighbors.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=\"p5\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The cases are currently on appeal at the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, but the verdicts have already caused lasting, positive change in the industry.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span></p>'

  blog: '<p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\"><b>6/15/20</b></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">In a carefully-reasoned, 73-page decision issued on June 12, 2020, Thomas D. Schroeder, the Chief District Judge of the Middle District of North Carolina Federal Court, found that portions of North Carolina General Statute § 99A-2 were unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case had been filed on January 13, 2016 and has drawn the attention and involvement of numerous interest groups.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">The underlying bill was passed over the veto of then-Governor Patrick McCrory by the North Carolina General Assembly on June 3, 2015.&nbsp; At that time, Dan Forest was the President of the N.C. Senate and Tim Moore was the Speaker of the House of Representatives.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">While then-Governor McCrory was generally a supporter of agricultural interests, even he felt the bill had gone too far.&nbsp; In his veto statement, Governor McCrory stated in part regarding the bill, “I believe it does not adequately protect or give clear guidance to honest employees who uncover criminal activity. I am concerned that subjecting these employees to potential civil penalties will create an environment that discourages them from reporting illegal activities.”<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">At the time the bill was passed, the Wallace and Graham law firm had been litigating its North Carolina Hog Farm Nuisance cases for two years.&nbsp; Those cases, originally brought in state court and then re-filed in federal court, allege that neighboring families of certain of the industrialized swine growing operations in the eastern part of the State have had to deal with obnoxious and unreasonable levels of foul odor, flies, heavy trucks, and other nuisances.&nbsp; The lawsuits also allege the communities pre-dated the industrialized hog operations.&nbsp; Five of those cases went to trial in the 2018 and 2019 time period.&nbsp; Since then, appeals have been filed, and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals heard the oral argument of the first appeal in January 2020.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">At the time that the bill was passed, it was widely perceived as being an “Ag-Gag” bill meant to make it harder to report evidence of unlawful conditions inside of agricultural facilities.&nbsp; Free-speech advocates criticized the bill for seeking to impose on First Amendment rights.&nbsp; In the hog farm nuisance cases, the Plaintiffs had to file a motion with the Court simply to obtain access for their scientific experts to enter the facilities to make measurements and take samples.&nbsp; There was evidence that the swine operations had fences and “no trespassing” signs and that it was impossible for neighbors to actually see what the conditions were inside of the enclosed hog sheds, from outside the property line.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">While at the time of the bill’s passage it was widely viewed as an attempt to stifle attempts to investigate and report on industrialized animal growing operations, in fact the language of the bill itself went far beyond just the agricultural sector.&nbsp; The main part of the bill, enacted as North Carolina General Statutes Section 99A-2, did not seek to limit itself only to agricultural operations.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">Rather, the new law, enacted as Session Law 2015-50, stated broadly that “[a]ny person who intentionally gains access to the nonpublic areas of another&apos;s premises and engages in an act that exceeds the person&apos;s authority to enter those areas is liable to the owner or operator of the premises for any damages sustained.”&nbsp; N.C. Gen. Stat. § 99A-2.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">In the Court case, those challenging the scope of the bill included People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the Center for Food Safety, the Animal Legal Defense Fund, Farm Sanctuary, Food &amp; Water Watch, the Government Accountability Project, Farm Forward, and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">In addition, numerous First Amendment advocates and news media free-speech advocates joined in submitting briefs that supported those suing.&nbsp; These groups included the American Society of News Editors, The Associated Press Media Editors, Association of Alternative Newsmedia, Capitol Broadcasting Company, First Look Media Works, Forbes, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Gannett and many others.&nbsp; The prominent Law Professors, Erwin Chemerinsky and Jack Preis also filed a brief.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">The initial complaint was brought against Defendants the North Carolina Attorney General (charged generally with defending any new laws once they are in place), and the Chancellor of UNC-Chapel Hill.&nbsp; The reason why UNC was named was because one of the Plaintiffs, the PETA group, alleged that it had a specific concern with potential animal cruelty issues at UNC animal testing laboratories.&nbsp; The initial complaint also pointed to a prior investigation at a North Carolina hog farm that supplied Smithfield Foods.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">After the complaint was initially filed, the Defendants filed a motion that sought to dismiss the case on the grounds that it was too speculative to say that the animal-rights organizations who were suing would in fact be subjected to adverse action under the new law if they sought to investigate animal cruelty issues.&nbsp; Judge Schroeder granted the motion to dismiss in a 38-page Order that was filed on May 2, 2017.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">On June 5, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the decision.&nbsp; It found that the Plaintiffs had shown enough standing to be entitled to proceed further in Court.&nbsp; In its decision, the Fourth Circuit noted that the Plaintiffs were “alleging that the Act interferes with their plans to conduct undercover investigations of government facilities in North Carolina for the purpose of gathering evidence of unethical and illegal animal practices and to disseminate this information to the public, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and various provisions of the North Carolina Constitution.”<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">After the case returned before Judge Schroeder, there were multiple additional documents and briefs that were filed.&nbsp; The matter was orally argued in the Court on February 6, 2020.&nbsp; On June 12, 2020, the District Court issued its new, 73-page Order.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">The new Order is very detailed and specific.&nbsp; The Order finds that parts of the new bill violate the constitutional rights of free speech.&nbsp; In some respects, the Order only finds that the new law is unconstitutional as applied to specific facts, meaning, the ruling stops short of striking down the statute entirely.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">Legal practitioners working in areas involving rights of workers and whistleblowers to document unlawful workplace conditions are encouraged to review the Order.&nbsp; It also has ramifications for those who work in investigative media.&nbsp; The ruling is nuanced and it is important to note that privacy and access-to-information issues need to be evaluated based on their particular facts.&nbsp; For instance, in a medical setting, there may be HIPAA patient privacy laws in the mix.&nbsp; In some workplace environments, workers may have signed agreements regarding disclosure of corporate trade secrets.&nbsp; In addition, for some workplace safety violations, note that it may be a violation of law not to report dangerous and unsafe conditions.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">In recent months, the Wallace and Graham law firm has seen an uptick in workplace whistleblower issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; The new federal court decision hopefully will mean that workers who see unsanitary and unsafe infectious disease control conditions in food production, the health care industry, and elsewhere, have the ability to document and report what is happening at their workplaces.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">Asked to comment, founding partner of Wallace and Graham Mona Lisa Wallace stated:&nbsp; “We welcome this decision because it reinforces the rights and freedoms under our Constitution and the First Amendment.&nbsp; Free speech and a free press are important safety valves in our society.&nbsp; The new COVID-19 pandemic highlights how important it is for workers inside of affected facilities to be able to document unsafe conditions.&nbsp; By trying to gag the ability of American citizens to investigate and publicize poor conditions inside of plants, factories, nursing homes and other places of work, these laws increase the dangers not just to our freedom of speech but also to our basic safety.”</p>'

Accordius Health, owned by the Portopiccolo private equity group in New Jersey, owns and operates a chain of 50-plus facilities.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Acting on behalf of the caretakers of Marjorie Garvin, a resident at the Citadel, the Wallace and Graham law firm in Salisbury filed a claim on her behalf on April 21 in the Rowan County Superior Court. Sadly, we learned late yesterday that Margorie Garvin passed away. We are dismissing her complaint at this time to allow the family to grieve and to get her estate in order. Now, joining with Steve Gugenheim, of Gugenheim Law in Raleigh, a lawyer who has spent the last 20 years prosecuting claims of nursing home abuse and neglect, a new Complaint along with witness statements has been filed. The new claim focuses on seeking a comprehensive review of the facility’s policies. It asks the Court to review the practices of the troubled care facility in order to prevent further neglect. The current claim seeks only injunctive relief, and not monetary damages, in order to force compliance with regulations and North Carolina law.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Speaking for Wallace and Graham, Mona Lisa Wallace said: “We felt we had no choice but to file this suit in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the elderly population and those dedicated to caring for them. The claim seeks to prevent the endangerment of the family members of residents and caregivers, our hospital workers, funeral directors and the community at large. We have received an overwhelming number of calls from families of residents, caregivers, employees and contractors. Their stories are heartbreaking. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them, and we will use our very best skills and talent to protect them and others in our community. We believe that the evidence confirms operational deficiencies on a massive scale, and we felt the most appropriate course of action was to seek Court intervention and request injunctive relief.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Speaking for the Gugenheim firm, Steve Gugenheim stated: “Our primary focus at this time is to fight for the health and safety of The Citadel’s residents and to ensure that The Citadel is operated in accordance with North Carolina law and follows the guidelines recommended by the CDC. We recognize and appreciate that the nurses and aides working in the trenches are doing the best they possibly can with the resources made available to them. Our goal is to ensure that the corporate owners of this for-profit nursing home provide The Citadel staff with appropriate personal protective equipment, ensure they are appropriately trained in COVID-19 pursuant to state and CDC guidelines, ensure there are sufficient staff in place to meet the care needs of the residents, ensure the facility maintains transparency and family members are timely and properly informed about the health condition of their loved ones, and ensure that The Citadel complies with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. We are concerned, based on sworn statements by multiple current and former employees, residents, and family members of residents, that the current management has not and is not taking appropriate measures to protect the health and&nbsp;</span><span>safety of residents and staff. We believe that Court intervention is necessary to ensure that management is adequately meeting the health and safety needs of its residents and staff in accordance with North Carolina law, rules and regulations.” </span></p>'

  title: 'Tips for Law Firms Seeking Funds Under The Paycheck Protection Program',
  date: 'Thursday, April 16, 2020',
  author: 'Janet Varnell',
  tag: 'Educational Information',
  blog: '<p>In response to the economic devastation created by the COVID-19 crisis, Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) as part of the CARES Act. The PPP provides extremely low-cost loans, which will be forgiven if a qualifying applicant spends the proceeds on payroll and a few other items. In the few weeks since the CARES Act has passed, a number of law firms who appear to qualify for its relief are still waiting for a response to their applications. While firms should seek out advice from all appropriate professions as they pursue support under the PPP, we set out here to offer several points that we’ve learned about the program.</p><p><strong>Tip One: Be Careful Selecting Your Bank</strong></p><p>Under the terms of the CARES Act, any qualifying small business (or qualifying non-profit) should have been able to apply through its FDIC-insured bank and there is no requirement for collateral, a credit check or the traditional trappings of a business loan. But it’s proving to be a little more complicated than that as banks set their own individual guidelines. Not all banks are proving equal in this crisis. Many larger banks have refused to accept applications from some businesses. This link on the SBA website provides a list of currently approved to file PPP loans:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/paycheckprotection/find" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">https://www.sba.gov/paycheckprotection/find</a>.</p><p>Experts also advise businesses to contact their local Small Business Development Center, Women’s Business Center, or SCORE, which all include experts who provide free guidance via phone and email. You can also search for lenders at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smartasset.com/insights/ppp-loan-lenders" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">https://smartasset.com/insights/ppp-loan-lenders</a>&nbsp;and it identifies whether the lenders accept applications from non-customers.</p><p>We have heard from a number of firms that have had better experiences with small lenders. They are far more likely to accept loan applications regardless of whether you have existing business with them. The smaller lenders not only submitted and gained approval from the SBA much more quickly, but have already delivered the proceeds of the loan in most cases. In many cases, it has been very hard for firms applying for PPP to reach a human being at larger banks.</p><p><strong>Tip Two: Ask Whether Your Application Was Actually Submitted to the SBA</strong></p><p>It is apparent that some lenders have accepted applications, but have not actually submitted them to the SBA for funding. We have learned of situations where applicants were given assurances both verbally and in writing that the application was “complete” or “accepted,” but later learned that the application had not been actually submitted to the SBA and accepted.</p><p>We are aware of instances of this occurring even where the application was submitted on April 3<sup>rd</sup>, the first day that applications were accepted. More precise questioning can help to determine if you are caught in this trap. You can inquire directly to your lender whether the loan application has been actually submitted to the SBA and whether the SBA provided funding confirmation. The SBA provides an instantaneous response to properly submitted PPP applications in most cases and your lender should be able to provide that to you.</p><p>This can be happening for a variety of reasons, some more nefarious than others. Part of the problem seems to be that there is relatively little economic incentive for a lender to submit a PPP loan. The lender receives only one percentage point on the loan and the good will value of customer service. At the innocent end of the continuum, some lenders have lacked enough portals to the submissions process, making it practically difficult for them to process loans in a timely manner.</p><p>There are other lenders, though, who created their own issues by imposing lender specific requirements. According to one Maryland federal court interpreting the CARES act in a case against Bank of America, this is permissible. Still other lenders appear to have accepted applications but have no intention of submitting applications to the SBA for their own business reasons. They likely accepted the applications initially because the lender wanted to appear to be serving its business customers out of fear those business clients would migrate to another banking institution.</p><p><strong>Tip Three: Explore Multiple Possibilities</strong></p><p>Because this is a moving target, a few experts suggest filing applications with more than one lender, so that you have a better chance you have of seeing some movement with at least one of them. This is tricky, however, as you cannot actually end up submitting more than one actual application to the Small Business Administration. &nbsp;With the worry about funding running out and some lenders changing priorities, it still makes sense to inquire with several lenders. This is simply a strategy to see who can fund you faster. (Ask for institutions to contact you before submitting for approval, so you can make sure you do not accidentally apply for multiple loans, which would be fraud under the PPP Loans provisions.)</p><p>In addition to the list of lenders listed above on the SBA website, several Fintech companies like PayPal, Intuit and Square have all been approved&nbsp;to participate in the PPP program as well. It appears that their processing time is much faster because their business model and processes are built for speed.</p><p><strong>Tip Four: Move Quickly!</strong></p><p>The reason for the urgency is that the $349 billion is clearly inadequate for the magnitude of need in the American small business community and is running out quickly. The Florida Banker’s Association reported yesterday that they believe the existing funds would all be gone by today or tomorrow at the latest. Lawmakers are pushing for more funds but it hasn’t happened yet.</p>'

Based on prior months&apos; performance, a policy may provide reimbursement for profits that would have been earned had the event not occurred.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Fixed costs</i>. These can include operating expenses&nbsp;and other incurred costs of doing business.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Temporary relocation</i>. Some policies cover the costs involved with moving to and operating from a temporary business location.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Commission and training costs</i>. A company will often need to replace equipment and retrain personnel. Business interruption insurance may cover these costs.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Extra expenses</i>. Business interruption insurance may reimburse reasonable expenses (beyond the fixed costs) needed to continue operating while the business gets back on solid footing.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Government closure loss</i>. A business interruption event may result in government-mandated closure of business premises.&nbsp;Examples include forced&nbsp;closures because of government-issued&nbsp;curfews&nbsp;or street closures related to an event.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Employee wages</i>. Coverage of wages is essential if a business does not&nbsp;want to lose employees while&nbsp;shutting down. This&nbsp;coverage can help a business owner&nbsp;make payroll until the crisis passes.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Taxes</i>. Businesses may still have to pay taxes, even when disaster hits. Tax coverage may ensure a business can pay taxes on time and avoid penalties.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Loan payments</i>. Loan payments are often due monthly. Business Interruption coverage can help a business make those payments even when they are not generating income.</span></li></ul><p class=\"p10\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>How do I know if I have Business Interruption Insurance? </b>You must locate your insurance policies and read through them carefully.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>If you cannot find them, contact your insurance agent or broker who may have copies.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Or, contact the insurer directly.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Remember that this coverage might be in a separate standalone policy but might also be buried within an all-risk, property or casualty policy or comprehensive package.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Also remember to check for add-ons, riders and amendments.&nbsp; If the insurer or agent will not cooperate with getting you information, contact a lawyer or the NC Department of Insurance (website: <a href=\"https://www.ncdoi.gov\"><span class=\"s4\">www.ncdoi.gov</span></a>). </span></p><p class=\"p5\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What if my insurance carrier denies my claim? </b>&nbsp;As a result of COVID-19, there have already been lawsuits filed by insureds against carriers who deny coverage.&nbsp;</span><span class=\"s5\"> For example, some restaurant businesses have brought lawsuits against their insurers for refusing to cover losses due to having to shut down their restaurants until the pandemic and local government closure orders pass. </span><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;If you have concerns that your Business Interruption Insurance coverage has been denied without good grounds, you should contact an attorney.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p11\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p12\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Nationwide Lawsuits Re: COVID-19</b></span></p><p class=\"p5\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">Below we summarize some examples of the legal claims that have appeared arising out of COVID-19 brought by business owners who had to close their business due to the virus. </span></p><p class=\"p5\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><i>French Laundry Partners, LP v. Hartford Fire Insurance Co</i>., Superior Court for the State of California, County of Napa, complaint filed March 2020.</b></span></li></ul><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Two high-class restaurants (The French Laundry and Bouchon Bistro) sued asking that the Court rule that their insurance coverage had to pay out for COVID-19 closure losses.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Their operations were shut down by a March 2020 directive from the Napa County health officer.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>This was a stay-at-home order for those who did not perform essential services.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The restaurants claim they are insured under an “all risks” policy issued by Hartford.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>They claim that their policy provides “civil authority” coverage for lost business income and extra expenses incurred if access to the restaurants is prohibited by an order of civil authority as a result of a covered loss in the area. </span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The restaurants assert that their policy coverage was triggered by the closure order issued by their local government authorities.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Further, the restaurant owners allege their policies do not include a “virus exclusion.” </span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">An issue brewing in that case is whether the insurance company can argue that to implicate the “civil authority” coverage, the claimant has to show that there was physical damage to property other than the premises.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The insurer may argue that the reason why businesses have been closed is for social distancing, not physical damage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The reason why the government ordered businesses in the area to shut down was not due to something like a tornado or other natural disaster that wrecked property in the neighborhood.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">That crux of the insurance company’s defense in this and other cases is expected to be that for business interruption coverage to apply (that is, coverage for the economic losses to an insured business owner arising out of having to close the business for a period of time), there has to be underlying physical property damage of a blatant, structural nature, such as fire damage after a lightning strike or an explosion.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">But this oversimplifies the issue.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Look at it through the claimant’s eyes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The small business owner who buys business interruption coverage pays an extra premium for the peace of mind of knowing that if an unforeseen event forces a temporary shutdown, he has insurance coverage to help get him through it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>If main street was closed down due to a flood of toxic waste, that could trigger coverage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Here, there has been another flood, only this time, of invisible virus particles.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>And the whole reason why government authorities are ordering shutdowns is because of the physical fact of the virus itself landing and staying on surfaces and people, floating through the air and causing infection and even death.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Thus, in the <i>French Laundry Partners </i>complaint, the restaurants allege that the COVID-19 virus has physically impacted “public and private property, and physical spaces in cities around the world and in the United States.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Further, the virus “physically infects and stays on surfaces of objects or materials, ‘fomites,’ for up to twenty-eight days.” And, “China, Italy, France and Spain have implemented the cleaning and fumigating of areas” before allowing those areas to re-opened to the public. Thus, the government’s stay-at-home order was “issued based on evidence of physical damage to property.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The claimants allege that they “faithfully paid policy premiums” to Hartford.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The coverage, known as “The Property Choice Business Income and Extra Expense Form,” was to be triggered “in the event of business closures by order of Civil Authority.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>(Complaint para. 14).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The coverage applies “to the actual loss of business income sustained and the actual, necessary and reasonable extra expenses incurred when access to the scheduled premises is specifically prohibited by order of civil authority as the direct result of a covered cause of loss to property in the immediate area of plaintiffs’ scheduled premises.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>(Complaint para. 15).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>“The policy is an all-risk policy, insofar as it provides that covered causes of loss under the policy means direct physical loss or direct physical damage unless the loss is specifically excluded or limited in the policy.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>(Para. 16).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>And, according to the plaintiffs, the “policy’s Property Choice Deluxe Form specifically extends coverage to direct physical loss or damage caused by virus.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>(Para. 17).</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><i>Cajun Conti, LLC v. Certain Underwriters at Lloyd’s London,</i> Civil District Court for the Parish of Orleans, Louisiana, complaint filed March 16, 2020.</b></span></li></ul><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This is said to be the very first lawsuit filed by any small business on the business interruption insurance coverage issue.<b>&nbsp;</b></span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Oceana Grill is a New Orleans restaurant located in the French Quarter.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The restaurant alleges that the insurer provided business property and business income insurance as “all risks” coverage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The restaurant contends that while the policy excludes coverage for things such as terrorism, the insurance covers a closure for a period of time due to contamination by a virus.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The business owners note that the Louisiana governor issued a restriction on public gatherings, and the mayor of New Orleans issued a restriction on restaurant operations.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>They allege that this triggers the Civil Authority provision of the Lloyd’s policy.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The complaint also notes that in Louisiana, there is case law stating that when a property suffers from lead or gaseous fumes intrusion, that event may trigger coverage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The lawsuit alleges that the restaurant had no choice but to close down due to the government’s orders once the virus hit.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><i>Big Onion Tavern Group LLC v. Society Ins. Co., </i>No. 1:20-cv-02005, U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Illinois, complaint filed March 27, 2020.</b></span></li></ul><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This is an insurance coverage lawsuit brought by numerous businesses in the Chicago area.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>One thing they all have in common is that they all purchased business interruption coverage from Society Insurance. The businesses suing include restaurants, taverns and pizzerias.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">They claim that they were forced to close their operations by government authorities as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The plaintiffs contend the insurer engaged in improper claims handling by issuing blanket denials for losses due to the closures.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>They claim that the insurer did not conduct any meaningful investigation before saying the claims were barred.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The complaint also alleges that the CEO of the insurer sent around a memorandum stating that his insurance company was likely not going to accept coverage in connection with losses caused by government-imposed shutdowns due to COVID-19.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Specifically, according to the lawsuit, the Society Insurance CEO issued a memorandum to “agency partners” saying that under Illinois law the policies would likely not cover such stoppages. That memo advised agents that “the current circumstances are unlikely to result in facts that support first-party coverage under our policies, or liability to a policyholder.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The memo stated: “Whether it be a full shutdown of business, a partial suspension of operations or an alteration in business operations that remain open, Business Income coverage must be due to a suspension caused by direct physical loss of or damage to covered property at the described premises. The loss or damage must be caused by or result from a Covered Cause of Loss. Extra Expense coverage also requires the same coverage triggers.

Liberty Mut. Fire Ins. Co</i>., 968 A.2d 724, 727 (N.J. Super. Ct. App. Div. 2009) – the claimants were supermarkets.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Their business was interrupted by a power outage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The court considered whether an electrical grid had experienced physical damage during the blackout.&nbsp; The Court determined that the electrical grid was physically damaged because, due to a physical incident or series of incidents, the grid and its component generators and transmission lines were physically incapable of performing their essential function of providing electricity.&nbsp; The Court rested its decision on the loss of function of the system as a whole.&nbsp; The parties were an insurance company, in the business of covering risks, and a group of supermarkets that paid for what they believed was protection against a serious risk — the loss of electric power to refrigerate their food. The Court concluded that an average policy holder in plaintiffs&apos; position would not have the narrow definition of physical damage which the insurer urged. “In this context, we conclude that if Liberty intended that its policy would provide no coverage for an electrical blackout, it was obligated to define its policy exclusion more clearly.” </span></li></ul><p class=\"p15\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s13\">Gasoline vapors</span> <span class=\"s1\">– <i>Western Fire Ins. Co. v. First Presbyterian Church</i>, 437 P.2d 52 (Colo. 1968).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Gasoline vapors penetrated the foundation of the insured church and accumulated, rendering building uninhabitable. The Colorado Supreme Court held that the church building&apos;s saturation with gasoline vapors constituted a &quote;direct physical loss&quote; when the building could no longer be occupied or used.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></li></ul><p class=\"p15\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s13\">Asbestos</span><span class=\"s1\"> -- <i>Port Authority v. Affiliated FM Ins. Co</i>., 311 F.3d 226 (3rd Cir. 2002). The Court held that “sources unnoticeable to the naked eye,” such as asbestos in the air, can be direct physical loss if they render a building “uninhabitable and unusable.” The Court found that physical contamination of the building rendering it useless would constitute physical loss under New Jersey insurance law.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The insurance company argued that physical loss or damage cannot occur without physical alteration. But the Court found that if &quote;the presence of large quantities of asbestos in the air of a building is such as to make the structure uninhabitable and unusable, then there has been a distinct loss to its owner&quote; which would constitute &quote;physical loss.&quote; The concept here is that a property can be physically damaged, without undergoing structural alteration, when it loses its essential functionality.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></li></ul><p class=\"p15\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s13\">Bacteria</span><span class=\"s1\"> -- <i>Motorists Mutual Ins. Co. v. Hardinger</i>, 131 Fed.Appx. 823, 825-27 (3rd Cir. 2005).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The Court found that if a building was rendered uninhabitable by dangerous gases or bacteria, this could trigger insurance coverage despite “direct physical loss or damage” policy language. Applying Pennsylvania law, the Third Circuit found that the bacteria contamination of a home&apos;s water supply constituted a "direct physical loss" when it rendered the home uninhabitable. </span></li></ul><p class=\"p15\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s13\">Soot in the air</span> <span class=\"s1\">– <i>Oregon Shakespeare Festival Ass&apos;n v. Great Am. Ins. Co</i>., No. 1:15-cv-01932-CL (D. Or. Jun. 7, 2016). The plaintiff Oregon Shakespeare Festival Association was insured by defendant Great American Insurance Company with a property insurance policy. The claimant alleged loss or damage to property when smoke from a nearby wildfire filled the theater in the summer of 2013, causing the insured to cancel performances and lose income.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The insurer argued that “loss or damage must be physical,” but the court found that there was no reason why the soot in the air was not physical. “Certainly, air is not mental or emotional, nor is it theoretical…. [W]hile air may often be invisible to the naked eye, surely the fact that air has physical properties cannot reasonably be disputed. Defendant&apos;s contention implies a different definition of &apos;physical&apos; altogether. Defendant implies that, in order to be &apos;physical,&apos; the loss or damage must be structural to the building itself. Defendant does not provide any evidence from within the policy to show that the plain meaning of the term &apos;physical&apos; includes such a limitation.”</span></li></ul><p class=\"p15\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s13\">Odor</span><span class=\"s1\"><i> -- Essex v. BloomSouth Flooring Corp</i>., 562 F.3d 399, 406 (1st Cir. 2009).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The court found that, under Massachusetts law, a foul odor rendering property unusable could constituted physical damage to the property.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The facts showed that during remodeling and carpet installation work, a foul odor emerged that was described as a "locker room" smell, a "playdough" smell, or a "sour chemical" smell. Some people complained that the odor caused headaches or other ill effects.</span></li></ul><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s13\">Sulfuric gas</span> <span class=\"s1\">-- <i>TRAVCO Ins. Co. v. Ward</i>, 715 F.Supp.2d 699, 709 (E.D.Va. 2010), <i>aff&apos;d</i>, 504 F. App&apos;x. 251 (4th Cir. 2013).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>This case found that there could be "direct physical loss" where a "home was rendered uninhabitable by the toxic gases" released by defective drywall.</span></li></ul><p class=\"p15\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s13\">Carbon monoxide fumes</span> <span class=\"s1\">-- <i>Matzner v. Seaco Ins. Co.</i>, 1998 WL 566658, 1998 Mass. Super. LEXIS 407 (Mass.Super.Ct. Aug. 12, 1998). The insureds claimed that carbon monoxide gas contaminated their apartment building, entitling them to coverage under an insurance policy that protected against direct physical loss or damage to property. The court first noted that the phrase "direct physical loss" was ambiguous&nbsp;and that it&nbsp;should be interpreted in the manner most favorable to the insured.&nbsp; The court ruled that carbon monoxide contamination constitutes a direct physical loss of or damage to property. </span></li></ul><p class=\"p15\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s13\">Ammonia</span><span class=\"s1\"> -- <i>Gregory Packaging, Inc. v. Travelers Prop. Cas. Co. of America, </i>No. 2:12-cv-04418, 2014 U.S. Dist. LEXIS 165232 (D.N.J. Nov. 25, 2004).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The court found a release of ammonia in an insured facility to be “direct physical loss or damage” despite no “structural alteration” to the facility itself.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>There, “the ammonia release physically transformed the air within Gregory Packaging’s facility so that it contained an unsafe amount of ammonia or that the heightened ammonia levels rendered the facility unfit for occupancy until the ammonia could be dissipated.”</span></li></ul><p class=\"p15\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"ul1\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s13\">Bacteria in home</span> <span class=\"s1\">-- <i>Motorists Mut. Ins. Co. v. Hardinger</i>, 131 Fed. Appx. 823, 825-27 (3rd Cir. 2005).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The court held <i>E.coli</i> contamination of a<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>water supply could be “direct physical loss” if it rendered the home inhabitable.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The question was whether bacteria caused direct physical damage under a homeowners policy. The homeowner had a private water well contaminated with <i>E.coli</i> bacteria. It caused illness to the insured’s family, including respiratory, viral, and skin conditions. The insurer argued that the bacteria had not caused a “direct physical loss,” which was necessary to trigger coverage under the policy. The Third Circuit denied the insurer’s motion for summary judgment. </span></li></ul><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; &nbsp;</span></span></p><p class=\"p16\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>Commentary on the Case Law&nbsp;</b></span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Depending on the exact terms of the insurance policy language, there is a potentially compelling argument that the “physical loss” requirement can be satisfied by the prevalence of the potentially lethal COVID-19 virus on surfaces and in physical premises – similar to the manner in which toxic bacteria, gases, fumes, asbestos fibers or other toxic contaminants can affect properties and make them temporarily lose their essential function.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">For example, assume that a railroad tanker car goes off the tracks and spills chemical gases throughout a community so that the nearby businesses must shut down.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The situation caused by the virus is not that different.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Like the toxic gas spill, the Coronavirus is an incursion of an unexpected toxic substance – the virus particles themselves – which rest and persist on surfaces, and travel through the air.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Unlike things like the common cold or the flu, the COVID-19 virus particles can cause horrific percentages of hospitalization and mortality.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>When the prevalence of the virus leads to governmental temporary shutdown orders, it may be argued that the virus has caused physical loss or damage by its contaminating and destructive effect.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Unlike the common cold or the flu, the COVID-19 virus is not a common everyday occurrence that society has simply grown to live with.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Rather, like the spill of toxic chemical gases into a community, or the detection of asbestos in a school building, the virus represents an unexpected, devastating, but temporary event, which will pass once it is controlled and recedes and once a vaccine is found.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This is the kind of unexpected damage that should be covered by business insurance because it falls into the range of what ordinary business owners thought they were paying for when they paid their premiums.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>They paid premiums for insurance to cover the unlikely event of a shutdown order and temporary business closures due to an unexpected disaster.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>A small business owner needs this coverage because even though eventually the pandemic will pass and closure orders will lift, this may come too late for small businesses without deep cash reserves.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>For those who work in the people-serving, in-person-service, hospitality space, weeks of a shutdown may put them out of business forever.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>It is no surprise, then, that some have already filed claims in court.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p16\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What You Can Do</b></span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Small business owners are advised to consult their policies and see if they contain language that provides coverage for losses incurred due to a business interruption.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The policy language must relate to events that trigger the suspension of their business operations, such as being forced to close due to a government order.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Also, one must check to see whether the insurance policy has an express exclusion for contamination due to communicable diseases or viruses.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Such a “virus exclusion” may preclude a claim.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If the policy is broadly worded and does not contain such an exclusion, this is a point in the small business claimant’s favor.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>This is because if the insurer had wanted to exclude pandemic-related losses under the policy, it could have sought to do so, but did not.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p17\"><span class=\"s1\">************</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you need help analyzing your policy language or understanding if your business may have a valid claim, please do not hesitate to contact our firm for assistance.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;

The Consumer Product Safety Commission stated that almost 18,000 individuals ended up in emergency rooms in 2017 alone.&nbsp; Injuries that can come from these parks can be life-threatening including fractured necks, fractured backs, and dislocated and open-fracture elbows.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The problem lies in the design. Several trampolines are connected to steel chains or links under very thin padding. As people jump, they create waves of energy and as they move with that energy, when they make contact or receive contact from someone twice their weight, they can end up with crushed bones. Allowing adults and children to jump and do flips at the same time creates a risk of collision that can lead to injury or death.&nbsp; Many injuries from these parks happen to adults, but children have also been a victim to trampoline park injuries.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Injuries can also result from employee negligence including lack of supervision, poor training, lack of security, and faulty equipment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Despite recurrent injuries and deaths, trampoline parks operate with no federal oversight, and in most cases, you will have obstacles seeking compensation if you are injured.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Upon coming to one of these parks, you are required to sign a waiver.&nbsp; These companies have deliberately made it more difficult to hold them accountable for damages caused by their parks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Families come to these parks expecting it to be safe, not knowing that it is not safe at all.

  blog: '<p><span>Wallace &amp; Graham’s Environmental Litigation</span></p><p>You may be aware of how the environment is being affected by climate change, fossil fuels, deforestation, or other environmental concerns. The right to a healthy environment and clean water is one of our most essential rights.&nbsp; A healthy environment promotes our natural way of life and survival. In fact, most of everything surrounding us is an extension of the environment:</p><ul><li><span>We use printed paper for our 9 to 5 jobs that comes from trees.</span></li><li><span>We use water that comes from water systems connected to streams, rivers, and lakes to wash our hands and cook our food.</span></li><li><span>We eat food grown in soil that contains nutrients that assist in food growth.</span></li></ul><p><span>The environment contributes to our daily lives in multiple ways and it is necessary and critical for us all to maintain and protect it. Wallace &amp; Graham has worked hard to ensure that corporate actors are fulfilling that obligation and duty to our environment.</span></p><p><span>One of the most notable cases Wallace &amp; Graham has tackled recently has been coal ash contamination. Duke Energy has been burning coal since 1911 in the Carolinas, and their first coal-fired plants were developed in Greensboro N.C., and Greenville, S.C. One of the biggest challenges is how to burn coal cleanly and sustainably.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Coal Ash contains toxins that can harshly affect individuals and the environment such as:</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><span>Chromium</span></li><li><span>Arsenic</span></li><li><span>Lead</span></li><li><span>Selenium&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Coal Ash toxins can dissipate through the topsoil and have the potential to pollute waterways, groundwater, and the air. Those toxins can move through the environment by runoff and erosion. In turn, that runoff and erosion can contaminate streams and rivers that can harm wildlife.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>When the Dan River spill occurred, the residents’ quality of water was called into question. After the spill, the Coal Ash Management Act was passed by the state legislature in 2014.</span></p><p><span>In 2016, the Coal Ash Management Act was amended, and HB630 stated Duke must provide connections to public water supplies and filter systems. Several residents of neighborhoods near Duke coal plants began and continue to speak out against the effects of Coal Ash.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Wallace &amp; Graham filed a lawsuit in Raleigh on behalf of residents that lived within one-half mile of coal ash ponds at Duke’s plants. The ponds were unlined, and litigants alleged that contaminants may have leaked and harmed their environment and property.</span></p><p><span>Our firm has worked to investigate and minimize negative environmental impacts that have affected over 400 neighbors of coal ash ponds in</span><i><span> Brown, et. al. v. Duke Energy</span></i><span>. The Duke Energy coal ash litigation is an example of just one matter that Wallace &amp; Graham has pursued to promote a healthy environment.</span></p><p><span>Today challenges with the environment continue to press on as it becomes imperative for us to contribute, protect, sustain, and resolve issues. Wallace and Graham’s law firm is proud to be a part of litigation aimed to protect and/or restore the environment. If you have any concerns regarding nearby hazardous operations or conditions near might affect you, family, or environment please call Wallace&amp; Graham P.A. at (704) 633-5244.</span></p><p></p>'

Symptoms may range from none to fatal, and may include:</p><ul><li><p>Dry and crackling sounds in your lungs when you inhale;</p></li><li><p>Chest pain;</p></li><li><p>Tightness of your chest;</p></li><li><p>Persistent cough that is constantly expelling mucus;</p></li><li><p>Shortness of breath; and</p></li><li><p>Loss of appetite.</p></li></ul><p>As of 2018, there is <a href=\"science-update" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/science-update\">no cure for asbestosis</a>.

It was early in his career, and he didn’t want to be seen as a rabble-rouser.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you’re too vocal sometimes,” he says, “things can go sour.”</p><p>He dates his turning point to a crisp, sunny day in 2012. Davis and his family were living in his grandparents’ old house, across the road from where he grew up, on land that straddles Wilson and Greene Counties. He and his eight-year-old had been on a father-daughter outing. They arrived home, he says, to an odor that had wafted over from the nearby hog facility, Stantonsburg Farm. Swine operations don’t export their odor 24-7. But at its worst, the manure smells like “<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3672924/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">rotten eggs and ammonia</a>,” says the federally funded journal&nbsp;<em>Environmental Health Perspectives</em>. It chases people indoors and sticks to clothing, to the point that Davis and his wife no longer hang their laundry outside to dry.</p><p>When they stepped out of the truck, Davis says, the stink was particularly strong.</p><p>“Dad, why do we have to live like this?” he recalls his daughter asking. “When I go to my friends’ house, I don’t smell this smell.”</p><p>The question thwacked Davis. He had grown up swimming and fishing in the nearby sandpits and creeks, and expected his kids to have a footloose childhood, too. When his oldest son—now an adult—was a child, they would pitch tents on their own property and camp overnight.&nbsp;</p><p>“We didn’t go to the mountains or wherever,” he says. “We&nbsp;<em>live</em>&nbsp;in the country.”</p><p>His two younger kids have had a more ambivalent relationship to the outdoors.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s not like we stayed inside with the blinds pulled,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>But living near Stantonsburg Farm, which has a permit to raise 4,800 pigs at a time, has meant less camping and fishing. The children didn’t have birthday parties around the swimming pool, because they never knew when the smell would chase everyone inside. That uncertainty, he says, has taken a toll.&nbsp;</p><p>“A man’s home is his castle, and he feels he needs to defend his castle, and so it makes you feel weaker,” he says. His children have noticed their parents’ helplessness, he says, and have internalized it themselves: “It makes them not as bold. Makes them not as daring. Makes them not as willing to challenge.”</p><p>Stantonsburg Farm raises the pigs for the Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, which is owned by a Chinese company. In 2014 Davis signed on as one of more than 500 plaintiffs suing Smithfield’s hog-production subsidiary, then called Murphy-Brown. The 26 lawsuits allege that industrial hog farming makes life intolerable for those living nearby—in legal parlance, that it creates a “private nuisance.” The plaintiffs live near farms contracted to, or owned by, Smithfield. They allege that the facilities produce a recurring stench and attract flies, buzzards, and late-night truck traffic.&nbsp;</p><p>The lawsuits claim that Smithfield can control the nuisance by changing how its farmers dispose of the pigs’ urine and feces. The waste is currently flushed into large open pits called “lagoons,” where it sits until growers spray it on their fields as fertilizer.</p><p>Smithfield insists that the nuisance claims are overblown and that alternative disposal technologies cost too much.&nbsp;</p><p>“From the beginning, the lawsuits have been nothing more than a money grab by a big litigation machine,”&nbsp;the company said in a 2018 statement. The company calls the suits “a serious threat to a major industry, to North Carolina’s entire economy, and to the jobs and livelihoods of tens of thousands of North Carolinians.”</p><p>But the company lost all five federal cases that went to trial in 2018 and 2019. Juries awarded 36 neighbors a total of almost $550 million, which the court dialed back to about $98 million because of a North Carolina law limiting punitive damages.&nbsp;</p><p>Davis’s case has not yet gone to trial. But on January 31, in Richmond, the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hold oral arguments in the first of Smithfield’s appeals. The appellate court’s decision will help determine whether Davis’s lawsuit moves forward—whether he can seek damages for what he calls his children’s diminished childhood.</p><p><strong>The case before the Fourth Circuit&nbsp;</strong>is called&nbsp;<em>McKiver vs. Murphy-Brown</em>. It involves a rural community in Bladen County and a swine facility that opened in its midst in the mid-1990s. Owner Billy Kinlaw had a contract with Smithfield’s Murphy-Brown subsidiary and a permit to raise more than 14,000 pigs at a time. Like all 26 lawsuits, this one was filed by Wallace and Graham, a Salisbury law firm that often takes on large corporations.</p><p>The trial took place at the U.S. District Court in Raleigh in April 2018. On the witness stand, Kinlaw’s neighbors recounted how the odor, buzzards, flies, and truck traffic upended their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>“My father was a sharecropper,” plaintiff Daphne McKoy, an administrative assistant, testified. “We didn’t have a lot, and what he did leave to his family was that little piece of land.”&nbsp;</p><p>Back then, she said, it was quiet, and the air was fresh: “You could spend all day on the porch or under the tree, but no one does that anymore. You can ride through and it looks like a ghost town compared to when I was coming up.”&nbsp;</p><p>Many of McKoy’s relatives still live along that road. But McKoy said she fears that when her own children grow up, they will settle down in less noxious surroundings.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re embarrassed by the odors,” she testified. “They’re embarrassed to have their friends over.”&nbsp;</p><p>Like Randy Davis, three counties away, McKoy said she felt frustrated by her inability to give her kids a pastoral North Carolina childhood.&nbsp;</p><p>“I would like for you to know how helpless I feel as a mother to hear them complain about how the kids say, ‘Your house smells like a trash dump,’” she told the jury. “I just want you to know how sometimes hopeless and helpless it feels.”</p><p>This frustration, argued plaintiffs’ co-counsel Michael Kaeske, was as avoidable as the smell itself. “Smithfield has saved untold millions of dollars by refusing to use alternative technology that will fix the problems,” he said during his opening argument. He added that Smithfield has tried to evade responsibility for the stench.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the documents Kaeske offered as evidence was a 1999 memo from a now-retired Smithfield executive, Don Butler, lauding the state’s new odor regulations. “The rules, as written, are so vague and subjective that enforcement will be difficult,” Butler wrote. “This may be to our benefit.”</p><p>Smithfield pushed back against the plaintiffs’ narrative. “There was never an odor issue raised about the Kinlaw farm before this lawsuit,” defense attorney Mark Anderson told the jury.</p><p>Among his witnesses was Jacquelyne Creed-Enloe, a neighbor whom the Kinlaws have invited over for oyster roasts and pig pickings. Her children sometimes visit the farm, too, she testified, and feed the resident donkeys. They wouldn’t do that, she said, if the farm had a strong odor. One daughter is “really prissy,” and her son “has a keen sense of smell, and he would have a meltdown. He can’t handle gassy smells.”</p><p>Over three weeks, the jury heard from parents and children, scientists, and industry leaders who told contradictory stories of life in swine country. Then the jury delivered a decisive verdict: Not only did Smithfield harm the plaintiffs, but it also committed such “egregiously wrongful acts” that it deserved to pay punitive damages. The jury awarded the 10 plaintiffs a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indyweek.com/news/northcarolina/will-raleigh-jury-s-50-million-verdict-murphy-brown-llc-force-big-pork-clean-act/\">total of $50.75 million</a>. State law reduced the award to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indyweek.com/news/archives/judge-britt-reduces-murphy-brown-s-punitive-damages-3.25-million/\">$3.25 million</a>.</p><p>Smithfield appealed the verdict, saying that Senior U.S. District Judge W. Earl Britt “committed numerous errors”—first among them “allowing the jury to consider and award punitive damages despite a lack of sufficient evidence.”&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the appeal that the Fourth Circuit will hear on January 31.</p><p><strong>After the&nbsp;<em>McKiver</em>&nbsp;verdict,</strong>&nbsp;Billy Kinlaw couldn’t understand how his farm, with its clean environmental record in the eyes of state government, could be the source of a multimillion-dollar jury award.&nbsp;</p><p>“Quite frankly, I’ve lost a lot of respect for the legal system,” said Kinlaw, who was not himself sued,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thefern.org/2019/12/rural-north-carolinians-won-multimillion-dollar-judgments-against-the-worlds-largest-hog-producer-will-those-cases-now-be-overturned/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">in an interview</a>&nbsp;for an article published by the Food &amp; Environmental Reporting Network and&nbsp;<em>The Nation</em>. “I’ve never had any type of violation, never had any type of write-up, and this is in 24 years. And now, all of a sudden, I’m a nuisance.”&nbsp;</p><p>The industry said the same thing. As part of the Fourth Circuit appeal, four industry groups argued that the court should consider the fact that state regulators have never cited Kinlaw Farms.&nbsp;</p><p>“[P]laintiffs’ legal theories do not target rogue operators who flout environmental laws,” said an amicus brief filed by the North Carolina Pork Council, North Carolina Farm Bureau Federation, and their national counterparts. “They challenge operators who comply with the law and carry out ordinary farming practices. It is no exaggeration to say that a plaintiff win in these lawsuits would subject the everyday activities of all farmers to punitive damages.”&nbsp;</p><p>If Randy Davis’s lawsuit makes it to trial, it will be harder for Smithfield and the industry to make that argument. Stantonsburg Farm, which generates an estimated 12 million gallons of hog waste a year, has received multiple write-ups by regulators over the past quarter-century.</p><p>The first came in January 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>Prakash Menon was on emergency standby for the state Division of Environmental Management when his beeper interrupted a Saturday afternoon. Menon, an environmental engineer, was summoned to Stantonsburg, where he saw stagnant pink liquid in the ditches lining both sides of a rural road. (Bacterial action turns hog waste pink.) Several neighbors, including Davis, were there to meet him.</p><p>The discharge came from Stantonsburg Farm, according to a violation notice issued by the state government. And it emptied into Contentnea Creek, where Davis had spent so much of his youth. Contentnea Creek, in turn, flows into the Neuse River.&nbsp;</p><p>“Wastewater of this nature has the potential to deplete dissolved oxygen in the affected water body to a point which is harmful to aquatic life,” said a DEM inspection report stemming from the incident. But when Menon showed up at the farm, the manager refused him entry. The engineer had to call the Greene County Sheriff’s Office for help.</p><p>On a follow-up visit, two other DEM employees found dead pigs improperly dumped in a drainage area, half-covered with water. During that visit, according to state records, the manager again was “not cooperative.”&nbsp;</p><p>The 1995 incident was one of several noted by regulators, including waste discharges in 1999, 2009, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kinston.com/article/20130410/News/304109986" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">2013</a>. All the while, neighbors continued to complain.&nbsp;</p><p>“How would you feel if you couldn’t drink the water from your own well, go to church without the smell of hog waste permeating your clothing, or even have a barbecue with friends on your own property?” said Don Webb, a plaintiff and former hog farmer, in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://waterkeeper.org/news/groups-target-illegal-swine-waste-discharges/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">2014 statement</a>&nbsp;released by the Waterkeeper Alliance, an environmental group.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shingletonfh.com/obituaries/Don-Webb-4/#!/Obituary" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">Webb died in 2018</a>.</p><p>Stantonsburg Farm is owned by Murphy Family Ventures, a company founded and headed by Wendell “Dell” Murphy Jr. He’s the son of Wendell Murphy Sr., who pioneered the expansion of North Carolina’s swine industry and also served in the state legislature from 1983–93. As&nbsp;<em>The News &amp; Observer</em>&nbsp;chronicled in “<a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/news-observer-raleigh-nc" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">Boss Hog</a>,” its 1995 Pulitzer-winning investigation, the elder Murphy and his legislative allies championed laws to protect the industry, including sales-tax exemptions and restrictions on county zoning powers.&nbsp;</p><p>Smithfield’s subsidiary, Murphy-Brown, leased and managed Stantonsburg Farm from 2002–12.&nbsp;</p><p>Smithfield declined an interview request for this article and declined to answer questions by email. Representatives of Murphy Family Ventures and Stantonsburg Farm did not return phone calls.&nbsp;</p><p>In its formal response to the lawsuit, Smithfield acknowledged “a few instances where application of effluent at the Stantonsburg Farm resulted in runoff onto neighboring land and waterways.” The company added that the farm and its owners “undertook efforts immediately to remediate any runoff,” and that Smithfield has worked with the farm to minimize the smell and generally improve its environmental performance.</p><p>Over the past three years, Davis says he’s noticed a change: “The hog operation has been very minimal nuisance.” He wonders if this is a result of the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p><p>The relief has brought Davis little comfort.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some people say, ‘Well, aren’t you happy about that?’ Well, no. That made me mad as hell.” To him, the improvement shows that Stantonsburg Farm could have mitigated the odors all along. “But it cost pennies more to do it, where you can be a better neighbor versus you don’t give a crap about your neighbor.”</p><p>“The last three years of my life living here has been great,” he says. “The prior 20 years, it was hell.”</p></div></div></article></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"at-share-dock-outer addthis-smartlayers at4-visually-hidden addthis-smartlayers-mobile\">&nbsp;</div>'

  title: 'New Study Suggests Link Between Talcum Powder and Malignant Mesothelioma',
  date: 'Tuesday, January 14, 2020',
  author: 'Wallace &amp; Graham, P.A.',
  tag: 'Asbestosis &amp; Mesothelioma',
  blog: '<p>A new study by the <em>Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine</em> shows that baby powder contains talc that causes cancer. While several jury trials were in favor of the patients, Johnson &amp; Johnson appealed most of them on the grounds that the cases have conflicting evidence and “no proof.” To understand why baby powder might have cancer-causing talc – or asbestos – in it, you have to understand a few things, including the in it, you have to understand a few things, including the difference between talc and asbestos.</p><h2>Talc and Asbestos</h2><p>Both elements occur naturally on earth and both are mined products. However, a talc deposit might be contaminated with chrysotile asbestos, which is the cancer-causing agent. Once the miners mine the talc, they must purify it to get rid of the chysotile asbestos, if the deposit they found was contaminated. The <a href=\"johnson-johnson-baby-powder-recalled-due-to-asbestos-exposure/" target=\"_blank\" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/johnson-johnson-baby-powder-recalled-due-to-asbestos-exposure/\">chemical makeup</a> for both products are very similar. In fact, they both contain magnesium, silicon, oxygen and hydrogen, but in different amounts. It’s when you have more or less of one or more of the elements that determine whether the element causes cancer or is harmless talc.</p><h2>Why Baby Powder Causes Mesothelioma</h2><p>In some cases, the miners do not get all of the chrysotile asbestos out of the mined talc, and the cancer-causing agent ends up in talcum powder. The FDA does not regulate beauty products, and that includes talcum powder. The above-mentioned study looked at 33 people, all of whom the researchers were able to show had no other exposure to anything that caused mesothelioma other than the baby powder. All 33 people had mesothelioma and all 33 used baby powder consistently.</p><p>When consumers use baby powder that is laced with chrysotile asbestos on a daily basis, or even several times per week, they breathe in the talcum dust, which contains asbestos. It’s the traces of asbestos in the talcum powder that causes cancer, not the talc itself. There have also been a few cases where women using baby powder for feminine hygiene have gotten ovarian cancer because of the asbestos in the baby powder.</p><p>While researchers have advised people to use something other than baby powder, those who have been using it for many years still have the risk of developing cancer from the chrysotile asbestos that was not removed from the talc before it went into baby powder.</p><h2><strong>Talc and Asbestos in Other Products</strong></h2><p>Baby powder is not the only cosmetic that uses talc. You can find talc in blush and other beauty products. However, the type of asbestos found in talc is not the same as the type of asbestos found in insulation and other products. Because of this, researchers were able to pin down the reasons for mesothelioma and ovarian cancer as cosmetics, including baby powder, made from talc. If you are currently using baby powder or other products with talc in them, you should switch to a substitute product that does not have talc in it. If you have been using baby powder for many years, especially on a daily basis, you should keep an eye out for the symptoms of mesothelioma and ovarian cancer.</p><h2>Contact Wallace &amp; Graham</h2><p>If you have a diagnosis of mesothelioma or ovarian cancer and you frequently use baby powder, <a href=\"contact-us" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/contact-us\">contact Wallace &amp; Graham</a> to set up a consultation to discuss your case.</p>'

  title: 'Johnson &amp; Johnson Baby Powder Recalled Due to Asbestos Exposure',
  date: 'Friday, December 20, 2019',
  author: 'Wallace &amp; Graham, P.A.',
  tag: 'Asbestosis &amp; Mesothelioma',
  blog: '<p>During recent testing in October 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that one lot of Johnson’s Baby Powder contained chrysotile asbestos. At the same time, the FDA tested another lot, and that lot was not tainted with asbestos. The FDA recommended those who had baby powder from the tainted lot – Lot #22318RB – to return the powder or at the very least, get rid of it since asbestos could cause cancer.</p><h2>How Does Talc Get Contaminated with Asbestos?</h2><p>Talc and asbestos are naturally occurring products. However, when the miners find a talc deposit, they must be sure that the site isn’t contaminated with chrysotile asbestos. Miners also have to purify the talc ore so that it doesn’t contain chysotile asbestos. The two minerals are closely related and are found in similar areas. In fact, the <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Chrysotile" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Chrysotile\">chemical make up for chrysotile asbestos</a> is Mg<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, Mg<sub>3</sub>(Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)(OH)<sub>4</sub> or H<sub>4</sub>Mg<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>, depending on the type of chrysotile asbestos, while the <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/talc" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/talc\">chemical formula for talc</a> is H<sub>2</sub>Mg<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>. As you can see, asbestos and talc both contain magnesium, silicon, oxygen and hydrogen.</p><h2>Talc Recall</h2><p>Because the FDA found chrysotile asbestos in that one batch of talc, Johnson &amp; Johnson voluntarily recalled Johnson’s Baby Powder. Asbestos is a carcinogen, which causes cancer. Although cosmetics are held to a lower standard than food and do not have to be reviewed by the FDA, manufacturers must be sure that no harm comes to users. The FDA sporadically tests talc and cosmetics. However, the agency worked on an on-going survey since 2018 and will continue testing. Thus far, the FDA tested about 50 cosmetic products. Two lots of Johnson’s Baby Powder were included in this testing.</p><p>Because chrysotile asbestos was found in one of the lots, the FDA will continue to test samples of cosmetic products that contain talc, including baby powder, though the agency’s available resources are limited.</p><h2>The Cancer Fight</h2><p>Some patients blamed <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/\">ovarian cancer and mesothelioma</a> on the use of Johnson’s baby powder. Johnson &amp; Johnson deny that their product has dangerous levels of asbestos in it. However, if the asbestos that might be in baby powder reaches the ovaries, it could cause ovarian cancer. It could also cause mesothelioma.</p><p>Allegedly, Johnson &amp; Johnson tested their product as early as the 1970s and found asbestos in it, but deferred to the FDA’s findings. However, the FDA does not test every lot, so it’s hit or miss as to whether the FDA will find asbestos in the talc used to make baby powder.</p><p>If you have ovarian cancer or mesothelioma and suspect the use of baby powder might have caused it, contact Wallace &amp; Graham to discuss your situation. We will help you notify the FDA that the use of baby powder may have caused your cancer.</p><p>The fight against contaminated baby powder is not new – people have been making accusations against talc companies for decades. However, it is only recently that some juries have been siding with those living with cancer after reviewing evidence, especially those with ovarian cancer.</p><h2>Contact Wallace &amp; Graham</h2><p>If you have ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, or another cancer that may have been caused by asbestos and you use a lot of talc products, contact Wallace &amp; Graham for a consultation to discuss your case.</p>'

  date: 'Wednesday, November 20, 2019',
  author: 'Wallace and Graham, P.A.',
  tag: 'Class Actions &amp; Consumer Rights',
  blog: '<p><strong>The following article was written by Mark Wineka of the Sailisbury Post:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>SALISBURY — Velvie Gray had worked at the Durafiber plant off U.S. 70 since 1978 and kept his job through all the different owners and name changes over the years.</p><p>After stints as a “tugger” and working in the spin draw department, Gray went to work in plant maintenance in 1984-85, and he stayed with that section until the plant closed Sept. 12, 2017.</p><p>Before the closure, G bray had a medical procedure at Iredell Memorial Hospital on Aug. 21, 2017, staying in the hospital until Aug. 23. His medical expenses exceeded $60,000, and he later learned that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, which he assumed was his health insurance provider, had denied his claims.</p><p>After a self-pay discount from the hospital, Gray still owed more than $18,000, toward which he had to make monthly payments. Blue Cross also had declined to pay anything for the prescription drugs and physical therapy he required.</p><p>Gray is among five Rowan Countians listed as lead plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of former Durafiber workers Monday in Civil Superior Court. They are represented by the Salisbury law firm of Wallace &amp; Graham, with Mona Lisa Wallace and John Hughes as their attorneys.</p><p>The other Durafiber workers in the lawsuit are Gary Honbarger, Monica Raney, Crystal Reese and Norman Richard Rufty.</p><p>Named as defendants in the case are Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina; Frank Papa, chief executive officer of Durafiber; Erwin Bette, chief financial officer of Durafiber; and FTI Consulting, the chief restructuring officer that handled the Durafiber bankruptcy.</p><p>The suit asks for a jury trial.</p><p>The closed plant is at 7401 Statesville Blvd. (U.S. 70). Over the years, depending on ownership, it went by Fiber Industries, Hoechst Celanese, Kosa, Invista, Performance Fibers, and, from 2014 until its closing, Durafiber Technologies.</p><p>According to the action, Blue Cross provided group health benefits to Durafiber workers based on “stripped-down coverage under an ‘administrative service only’ or ASO product.”</p><p>Under the arrangement, Durafiber had the obligation to fund the health care plan.</p><p>The suit alleges&nbsp;Papa and Bette, looking to minimize costs and shed as many company obligations to the workers while plant closings and bankruptcy were underway, knew the ASO arrangement with Blue Cross “would allow them to ignore and avoid paying numerous claims.”</p><p>In effect during the bankruptcy, the suit alleges, Durafiber was treating workers with &nbsp;group health benefit claims “like ordinary vendors they could ignore.”</p><p>But the plaintiffs claim that even though Durafiber had the obligation to fund the group health plan, Blue Cross had its own duties to “provide truthful and accurate claim information to participants, such as whether there were really funds to pay claims.”</p><p>The suit says Blue Cross represented to Durafiber workers that they had coverage. As late as Sept. 27, 2017, Blue Cross was sending written certifications to plan participants that assured them they were covered until Sept. 30, 2017.</p><p>The workers carried Blue Cross/Blue Shield cards. They received Blue Cross-drafted benefits booklets through their network providers.</p><p>After company officials held a plant meeting in July 2017 about the possible plant closures in Salisbury, Shelby and Winnsboro, many of the Durafiber workers began scheduling medical appointments and procedures because they had been told their insurance coverage would end Sept. 30.</p><p>Their premiums continued to be deducted from their paychecks. They learned later from doctors and hospitals that Blue Cross was denying their claims.</p><p>“After lengthy delays,” the suit says, “Blue Cross refused to pay the claims, declaring to the aggrieved plan participants that per the Blue Cross ASO contract, which workers never saw, Durafiber had the obligation to fund the plan.</p><p>“… As a result, the plaintiffs, who had now lost their jobs after Durafiber closed, were barraged by unexpected medical bills and charges. Many had their credit ratings devastated by no fault of their own,” the suit says.</p><p>The suit contends Blue Cross still had obligations to the workers.</p><p>“Blue Cross knew or should have known that Durafiber was failing to make payments and was a corrupt ‘plan administrator,&apos;” the action says. “Blue Cross continued to administer the plan as if all was well, assuring plaintiffs they were covered and never warning them otherwise.</p><p>“Blue Cross breached its duty to competently manage the plan.”</p><p>As for Papa, the suit contends his July 13, 2017, letter to employees misrepresented that the coverage cutoff for their group health plan was Oct. 1, 2017.</p><p>The suit also claims Papa and Bette controlled what claims were paid and that FTI Consulting, the restructuring officer, “contributed to cause the failure to pay valid benefit claims of workers receiving medical care under the plan.”</p><p>The suit adds, “None of the plaintiffs knew that Durafiber and its top executives were planning to manipulate assets and liabilities so as to leave ordinary workers holding the bag and facing ruinous medical expenses because Durafiber refused to self-fund the benefits plan.”</p><p>“It just breaks my heart,” Wallace said in a telephone Monday. “Our clients thought they had (coverage).”</p>'

  date: 'Thursday, October 24, 2019',
  author: 'Wallace and Graham, P.A.',
  tag: 'Work-Related Injuries',
  blog: '<p>Workers’ compensation laws state that every employer who has at least one person working for it must have workers’ compensation insurance. Private companies, federal organizations, local government organizations must all provide this insurance. Workers&nbsp;compensation laws also cover subcontractors. The insurance covers employees who are work or become sick on the job. It covers medical treatment, wage replacement, vocational rehabilitation and other benefits.</p><h2>How Does Workmans Comp Work?</h2><p>If you become sick or injured on the job, workers’ compensation insurance covers the illness or injury. The injury or illness must take place at work. Common claims include slip and falls, strains from heavy lifting, workplace violence, overexertion, falling, machinery accidents and employees getting hit by an object. If you became sick because of your workplace—not just because you caught a cold, but because you got cancer from working with chemicals on the job or another disease or illness because of the workplace, you might be covered by workers’ compensation.</p><p>Before you make a claim, ask yourself, “How does workers’ compensation work?” Visit your attorney before you take action, especially if you have a long-term disability or illness. While benefits include hospital and medical expenses, it only pays two-thirds of your salary. Every state’s workers’ comp laws are different. If your injury or illness is something you should be suing for, you need to <a href=\"how-does-worker-s-compensation-work/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/how-does-worker-s-compensation-work/\">speak to a workers’ comp attorney</a> before you file.</p><h2>Settlement for Workers’ Compensation</h2><p>A settlement for workers&nbsp;compensation has many benefits, but it also has many restrictions. While it does pay for medical expenses, you may have to get authorization for any medical treatment other than emergency medical treatment. If you obtain authorization, it may cover your medical expenses, including mobility equipment, including a special vehicle, wheelchair or walker. If you need therapy, it may cover that, whether psychological, cognitive or physical therapy, once approved.</p><p>Since workers’ compensation only covers approved medical practices, it might not cover an experimental drug or therapy that your doctor may prescribe. If you want or need alternative medicine or experimental treatment, you should contact an attorney.</p><p>Your <a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/types-of-workers-compensation-benefits-32962.html" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/types-of-workers-compensation-benefits-32962.html\">workers’ compensation settlement</a> may payout for:</p><ul><li><p>Medical expenses;</p></li><li><p>Disability benefits;</p></li><li><p>Death benefits; and</p></li><li><p>Rehabilitation benefits.</p></li></ul><p>In many cases, workers’ compensation might not cover everything. You do have the option to sue your employer. Before you apply for workers’ compensation, contact Wallace and Graham, P.A., to set up a consultation to discuss your case.</p><h2>How Does Workers’ Comp Pay You?</h2><p>Since workers’ compensation is a no-fault program, the injured employee, in most cases, cannot sue the employer for his or her injuries; thus, it is important to contact a workers’ comp lawyer before you file for benefits. In some cases, it might be beneficial to use the workers’ comp insurance, while in others, it might be more beneficial to sue the employer.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/how-does-workers-compensation-work-35401" target="_parent" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/how-does-workers-compensation-work-35401\">workers&nbsp;compensation exemption</a> also applies to some workers. Though every state is different, some workers that might not have coverage, including domestic workers, agricultural workers, independent contractors and seasonal workers. These workers would have to file a lawsuit against the employer to recover damages from an accident or illness.</p><p>Additional exemptions may include whether the employee was under the influence, intentional acts of the employee or employer and/or self-inflicted injuries. When you notify your employer that you suffered an injury on the job, it should give you a form to fill out and fact sheets that outline your rights, including answering the question, “How does workers&nbsp;comp pay you?”</p><h2>Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.</h2><p>Workers’ compensation is a complicated area of law. While you should be able to file a claim on your own, it is better to retain an attorney, especially if you believe that the benefits offered will not cover your injuries or if your injuries are expected to be long-term. <a href=\"workers-compensation-injury-claims" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/workers-compensation-injury-claims\">Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.</a> to schedule a consultation and to learn more about workers’ compensation benefits.</p>'

That is up 16 percentage points from a similar Reuters/Ipsos poll that ran in the spring of 2016.</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>It also found that only 29% of adults think vaping is a good way to help people quit smoking, and 77% said that vaping should be regulated at least as strongly as traditional cigarettes.</span></p><p>The survey was conducted Sept. 17-18, shortly before U.S. health officials lifted to 530 the number of confirmed and probable cases of lung-related illnesses linked to vaping. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating what has caused the outbreak that has so far killed seven people.</p><p>Retail giant Walmart also said Friday that it would pull e-cigarettes from its shelves due to health concerns and their apparent popularity among teenagers.</p><p>“This is the natural consequence of a seemingly unending stream of misleading news stories” about e-cigarettes, said Greg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, an advocacy group that is partially funded by e-cigarette makers.</p><p>Conley added that many of the vaping-related health issues involved people who used e-cigarettes to smoke street-bought drugs or liquids that contain ingredients from cannabis, not tobacco.</p><p>Investigators at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have pointed to vaping oils containing marijuana ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or vaping oils with vitamin E acetate, a substance used in some THC products, as a possible cause of the illnesses. But they have not ruled out anything yet, including conventional nicotine liquids.</p><p>E-cigarettes, which operate by heating a liquid that contains nicotine, have been popular for nearly a decade in the United States. While long-term health impacts from vaping remain largely unknown, some users view e-cigarettes as a healthier alternative that can help them quit smoking.</p><p>Earlier this month, the FDA issued a warning letter to Juul Labs Inc for marketing its e-cigarettes as safer than traditional cigarettes. Juul, which has said it is reviewing the FDA letter, also faces about 30 lawsuits alleging it illegally marketed products to children and failed to issue warnings to consumers about their dangers.</p><p><span>Juul has denied that it marketed its products to children.</span></p><p><span>Younger adults were much more likely than older people to have used vaping products, according to the poll. About half of all 18-34-year-olds said they either currently use a vaping device, or they have used one in the past - about five times the rate of usage of adults who were 55 or older.</span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>The poll did not measure the interest in vaping among minors. While it is illegal to sell nicotine delivery products to minors, the FDA has said more than 3 million U.S. high school students used e-cigarettes in 2018.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States.

  blog: '<p><span>What Type of Case is Personal Injury?</span></p><p><span>A personal injury case is a tort, and a tort is a wrongful act that results in harm to another person. An individual, business, or an employee could cause injury to another person. Personal injury cases could get complicated, so you should always retain a lawyer for personal injury claims, even something you might believe is small.</span></p><p><span>Cases that fall under the broad umbrella of </span><a href=\"https://www.injuryclaimcoach.com/personal-injury-claim.html\"><span>personal injury</span></a><span> include:</span></p><ul><li><span>Criminal acts that cause injury, including assault, battery, DUI and domestic violence;</span></li><li><span>Injuries to children at school or daycare;</span></li><li><span>Injuries suffered while playing sports or taking part in other recreational activities;</span></li><li><span>Work-related injuries;</span></li><li><span>Wrongful death cases, including nursing home deaths, car accident fatalities, and medical malpractice;</span></li><li><span>Dog bites;</span></li><li><span>Slip-and-falls;</span></li><li><span>Vehicle accidents; and</span></li><li><span>Product liability.</span></li></ul><p><span>A simple personal injury definition is that a person was injured because of the actions or inactions of another person or entity.</span></p><h2><span>How to Make a Personal Injury Claim</span></h2><p><span>The best way to make a </span><a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/personal-injury-claim\"><span>personal injury claim</span></a><span> is to contact a personal injury law attorney. When the attorney reviews your case, he or she will advise you as to whether you should try to settle or litigate the matter. Since it costs less to settle a claim than it does to litigate a claim, less for extenuating circumstances, you should try to settle first. The first step in a settlement is to write a demand letter. The letter may be ignored or you may get a response with a counter offer.</span></p><p><span>If the counteroffer is too low, you have two choices: Send another offer or let the defendant know that you will be taking the matter to trial. The defendant’s attorney may ask for discovery, even during settlement proceedings. You will have to provide documents that are requested. These usually include medical bills and other documents relating to the incident.</span></p><p><span>If you plan on going straight to </span><a href=\"https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/how-file-claim.html\"><span>litigation</span></a><span>, you need to have all the pertinent information. Once you file a lawsuit, you can’t add more requests.

  date: 'Friday, September 13, 2019',
  author: 'Wallace and Graham, P.A.',
  tag: 'In the News',
  blog: '<p><i><span>The following article is a news story from CNBC for more information, please visit:&nbsp;https://www.cnbc.com/2019/09/13/new-york-city-health-chief-alarmed-by-middle-school-children-vaping-rates.html</span></i></p><p><i><span>Pediatrician Dr. Oxiris Barbot is New York City’s health commissioner. Barbot previously served as medical director for New York City’s schools and Baltimore’s health commissioner from 2010 to 2014. She was also the chief of pediatrics and community medicine at a health clinic in Washington, D.C.</span></i></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>As a pediatrician, the beginning of the school year makes me think about both the exciting opportunities for children ahead and the health challenges they face. Guarding against unhealthy choices can be especially fraught for middle-school students, as they navigate new independence and friendships.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>For today’s middle-school students, that now includes the threat of nicotine addiction — and new Health Department </span><span>data</span><span> released this week reveals the extent of this threat. We are contending with an escalating public health crisis.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>In New York City last year, about 13,000, or 1 in 15, middle-school students reported that they currently use electronic cigarettes. The numbers also rose considerably by grade: 2.6% of 6th graders use e-cigarettes versus 8.4% of 8th graders.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Meanwhile, e-cigarettes are eroding historical gains in reducing the number of children potentially addicted to nicotine. Seventh graders were nine times more likely to use e-cigarettes than conventional cigarettes, while their 8th grade schoolmates were 6 times as likely to use e-cigarettes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>One of the many alarming things about these numbers is that e-cigarettes only became popular less than a decade ago. I have seen firsthand the dangers of nicotine use for young people. Part of my counseling as a pediatrician for parents and youth was educating them about the </span><span>dangers</span><span> of tobacco and nicotine.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Nicotine is a highly addictive substance — found in almost all e-cigarettes — and can change the chemistry of the teen brain, worsening memory and concentration for young people. In addition, the aerosol from e-cigarettes can contain cancer-causing chemicals such as formaldehyde and benzene; diacetyl, a chemical linked to serious lung disease; and heavy metals, including nickel, tin and lead.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The new data on youth vaping in New York City also coincides with alarming news from across the country of more than 380 probable or confirmed cases of severe lung illness associated with vaping, including six deaths.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The Trump administration supports a ban on the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes. I hope President Donald Trump’s words will match his actions. The federal government must act in order to protect thousands of children across the country. Although the details and exact cause of this illness are still being investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these cases highlight how much remains unknown about potential health impacts of vaping. Regardless, none of these products are safe for our youth.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Yet the tobacco industry is still raising hundreds of millions of dollars to increase sales in products that represent the future of nicotine addiction. The Marlboro maker, Altria Group, </span><span>$325 million</span><span> just last month to expand its reach.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>In a two-day hearing this summer, Congress and the FDA slammed Juul for its role in driving the youth vaping epidemic. The investigative </span><span>hearing</span><span> detailed what has long been reported, that Juul infiltrated schools, summer camps and youth programs — its products are becoming a part of the childhood experience for American youth.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Juul has since pulled many of its flavored products out of retail stores, but that is only leading to copycat products. The latest threat is “</span><span>Juul-alikes</span><span>,” which are compatible with Juul devices and come in candy and fruity flavors that appeal to kids — pina colada, cinnamon roll and strawberry donuts, to name a few.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We’ve seen this before. Tobacco companies will choose money over health every time.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Big Tobacco deployed nefarious </span><a href=\"https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0208.pdf\"><span>tactics</span></a><span> to promote menthol use in black neighborhoods; they lowered the price of these cigarettes in those communities and even handed them out for free. They poured millions into advertising. These strategies worked — currently </span><a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/smoke/menthol-tobacco-products-factsheet.pdf\"><span>more than 85%</span></a><span> of black Americans who smoke choose menthol cigarettes, compared with fewer than 5% in the 1950s.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Today, smoking remains a leading cause of death in New York City; about </span><a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/smoking-nyc-quits.page\"><span>12,000</span></a><span> New Yorkers die from smoking-related causes each year.</span></p><p><span>We cannot allow Big Tobacco to do the same damage to young people with e-cigarettes.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>As the City’s doctor, my advice to parents and young people is to stop using vaping products and learn more about the health risks of vaping. The popularity of e-cigarettes has risen extremely quickly, and we are only beginning to understand the full extent of the dangers. The </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm\"><span>CDC</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/smoking-nyc-quits.page\"><span>Health Department</span></a><span> websites have helpful resources, including fact sheets for both youth and parents, and information on the dangers of flavored tobacco and vaping products.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>We have concrete evidence that youth vaping is a frightening reality — even for children as young as 11. I urge everyone to use our data to advocate against Big Tobacco and call on your elected officials to act. The legislation before the New York City Council to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes that target youth is an important step in the right direction. We must put the health of our children first.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p>'

  date: 'Monday, September  9, 2019',

  blog: '<p>If your employer has&nbsp;<a href=\"how-does-worker-s-compensation-work/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/how-does-worker-s-compensation-work/\">workers compensation</a>&nbsp;insurance, you may apply to collect if you are injured at work. An employer, whether public or private, must have insurance if it has at least one employee. If you work as a subcontractor for a private firm, and you are not an employee, you cannot collect workers compensation. You do not get a workers&apos; compensation settlement, so to speak, as it doesn’t come in one lump sum. You generally get weekly payments that cover you while you are not able to work. These payments are about two-thirds of your salary. However, workers compensation does pay for medical expenses and death benefits if your loved one died in a work-related accident, and these benefits could be considered as a settlement.</p><p>If you do want to settle the claim, you most likely will not be entitled to any more payments. You should always contact a workers&apos; compensation attorney before you make such a decision.</p><h2>How Long Do Workers’ Compensation Claims Take?</h2><p>A claim may take a varying amount of time depending on the circumstances. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workcomp" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workcomp\">state’s workers compensation board</a>&nbsp;investigates the accident prior to approving you for workers compensation. If you work for the federal government, the Department of Labor Office of Workers Compensation Programs administers the programs.</p><p>If you are applying for a workers&apos; compensation future medical settlement because of long-term injuries, approval for a short-term claim may come before any long-term settlement. You will have to provide medical evidence that shows you may be entitled to future payments because of a long-term injury.</p><p>If you do decide to settle, you must go through a hearing to review the settlement. If the workers&apos; compensation hearing officer or judge deems that you understand the settlement and believes the settlement to be fair, the officer or judge will approve the settlement. Settlements take longer than accepting payments because you have to work out a fair amount, negotiate that amount and then attend the hearing.</p><h2>Workers’ Compensation Settlement Payouts</h2><p>If you wish to apply for a workers&apos; compensation settlement back injury, you may want to discuss your choices with an attorney. Back injuries and other catastrophic injuries are often long-term and sometimes permanent injuries.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/workers-compensation/should-you-settle-case.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/workers-compensation/should-you-settle-case.html\">Workers comp settlement</a>&nbsp;amounts may not be enough to cover the amount of time you are out of work or future medical bills, especially if you settle on your own. An attorney experienced in workers compensation law may be able to get you a fair settlement that could cover catastrophic injuries.</p><p>If your state covers medical expenses even if you settle a workers&apos; compensation claim, the insurance company may not pay the medical bills quickly, if at all.</p><p>Additionally, even if you do come to an agreement with the insurer, the state workers&apos; compensation agency must approve the settlement, including the amount that you will receive. It is best to consider whether the amount will be enough to cover everything, and if not, keep the claim open.</p><h3>Determining a Settlement Amount</h3><p>It is often difficult to determine an appropriate amount for long-term injuries. workers&apos;&nbsp;compensation attorneys will attempt to figure an amount that best covers what benefits you might be entitled to in the future—that is, if you were to keep the payments, and whether you would actually keep receiving the payments. Workers comp claims do not take pain and suffering, the loss of a loved one, loss of consortium, loss of companionship or punitive damages into consideration.</p><p>The amount for the settlement only covers you for lost time from work and medical benefits based on your medical records. And, if you are permanently disabled because of the injury, the claim must consider present value—that is, how much the insurance company will pay out over the next 20 years.</p><h2>Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.</h2><p>If you have been injured at work,&nbsp;<a href=\"workers-compensation-injury-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/workers-compensation-injury-claims\">contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.</a>&nbsp;as soon as possible to discuss your case.

  tag: 'Personal Injury &amp; Wrongful Death',
  blog: '<p>Determining an average settlement for a personal injury claim is difficult to do because of the different types of injuries and the scope of those injuries. Smaller&nbsp;personal injury claims&nbsp;may settle for an average of about $52,900. However,&nbsp;<a href=\"what-is-a-pi-lawyer" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/personal-injury-car-motorcycle-trucking-accidents\">NC personal injury attorneys</a>&nbsp;could help you get much more for those with severe injuries or in cases where the actions of another person or company caused permanent injury or death. People who retained personal injury law firms Charlotte NC got about 340 percent higher settlement than those who tried to settle on their own.</p><p>The higher amounts are usually because of negotiations—attorneys generally don’t take the first number offered by the insurance company. Additionally, if the defendant is found to be negligent, punitive damages may be awarded, and that increases the settlement by quite a bit.</p><h2>Personal Injury Settlement Benefits</h2><p>Retaining a personal injury lawyer, even if you have personal injury insurance or some other type of personal injury coverage is more beneficial than trying to settle the case yourself. In addition to the statistically higher amounts plaintiffs get in a settlement, a personal injury attorney takes a lot of the stress of your case off your shoulders. Some benefits include:</p><ul><li><p>Every court follows rules of civil procedure. In the event that your case doesn’t settle and instead, goes to trial, you could find out that your case has been dismissed if you don’t follow the rules.</p></li><li><p>Most types of personal injuries are backed by case law, particularly those that involve negligence. A personal injury attorney will be able to use statutes and case law to help you get a better settlement or a better outcome at trial if there was a precedent set for a case like yours.</p></li><li><p>Attorneys are used to dealing with insurance companies. In some cases, you may have to deal with more than one or two insurance companies. Working a settlement or bringing a case through litigation can get confusing when you are dealing with lawyers for so many insurance companies.</p></li><li><p>An attorney does research on the costs of personal injury claims and the medical bills that go along with it. While your medical bills may not be the same as another person who finds themselves in your situation, the attorney still has a good idea as to the cost of medical care and how much more care you might need. Because of this, the attorney will not let the insurance company throw out a low offer to settle.</p></li></ul><p>Almost all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hg.org/torts.html" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.hg.org/torts.html\">types of personal injury cases</a>&nbsp;have insurance companies involved. A dog bite case may have a homeowner’s insurance company involved while someone struck by a drunk driver has his own insurance company plus the other driver’s insurance company involved in the lawsuit.</p><p>A product liability case may have even more attorneys involved. For example, if a part on your vehicle was defective and caused an accident, your own insurance company and the other driver’s insurance company could be involved. Additionally, lawyers for the vehicle manufacturer, the vehicle manufacturer’s insurance company, the part manufacturer and the part manufacturer’s insurance company may also be involved. That is six sets of attorneys you have to keep up with and make sure every one of them gets copies of documents.</p><p>If you’ve ever been involved in a court case before, you know that trying to schedule a hearing between your attorney, you, the other person and the other person’s attorney can be difficult. Imagine doing that with six sets of attorneys! And, if you are trying to settle, you also have to negotiate a settlement amount from one or more of these attorneys.</p><h2>Contact Wallace and Graham</h2><p>If you have been injured in an accident or have a relative who has been injured but cannot call us because that person is physically incapable due to injuries, contact&nbsp;<a href=\"personal-injury-car-motorcycle-trucking-accidents" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/personal-injury-car-motorcycle-trucking-accidents\">Wallace and Graham</a>&nbsp;to set up a consultation.</p>'

Many types of accidents that cause harm or the death of a loved one are personal injuries.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>A personal injury attorney may try to </span><a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/damages-how-much-personal-injury-32264.html\"><span>settle a claim first</span></a><span>, but if he or she doesn’t get a good settlement offer, the attorney will take the case to trial. A case will settle faster than if it goes to trial, which could last years, depending on the circumstances and the parties involved. In some cases, it might be in your best interest to settle while in others, it’s in your best interest to go to trial. Your personal injury attorney will advise you as to the best course of action based on the facts of your case.</span></p><h2><span>Personal Injury Examples</span></h2><p><span>A personal injury definition, in a nutshell, is an </span><a href=\"https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/kinds-of-cases.html\"><span>injury or death caused by any type of action or inaction</span></a><span> by another party. If an accident caused a death, the next of kin may bring a personal injury case against the person that caused the death. Personal injury cases include:</span></p><ul><li><span>Vehicle accidents;</span></li><li><span>Boating accidents;</span></li><li><span>Plane accidents;</span></li><li><span>Train accidents;</span></li><li><span>Dog bites;</span></li><li><span>Slip and fall accidents;</span></li><li><a href=\"https://www.americanbar.org/groups/public_education/resources/law_issues_for_consumers/injury/\"><span>Injuries from defective products</span></a></li></ul><p><span>If you have been injured or a loved one died because of an accident, contact a personal injury attorney as soon as possible. Personal injury cases have a statute of limitations—this means that they must be filed within a certain period of time. In most cases, the </span><a href=\"https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/laws-north-carolina.html\"><span>statute of limitations for a personal injury claim</span></a><span> in North Carolina is three years for injury and two years for wrongful death. &nbsp; If you fail to file your claim within the limitations period, your claim could be dismissed as untimely.</span></p><h2><span>Do I Need a Personal Injury Lawyer?</span></h2><p><span>It is our recommendation that you get the advice and/or assistance of an attorney.&nbsp; You should keep in mind that insurance companies must look out for their bottom line. Often, insurance companies will offer you the lowest amount possible.&nbsp; The process of taking a case through settlement and litigation is not an easy process. For example, if you were in a car accident with a tractor-trailer truck, you are not only dealing with your insurance company’s lawyers but also lawyers for the driver’s and the business’s insurance companies.&nbsp; There are many complexities to handling a personal injury claim that requires legal assistance to maximize recovery.</span></p><h2><span>Contact Wallace and Graham&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></h2><p><span>Contact a personal injury lawyer near me—Wallace and Graham—if you have a </span><span>personal injury claim.</span></p>'

  blog: '<p><span>The Food and Drug Administration is issuing a nationwide recall of textured breast implants manufactured by Allergan. The Allergan implants have been linked to an unusual form of cancer and will be facing a global recall at the wishes of the FDA.</span></p><p>Despite being banned in Europe as of late last year, the sale of Allergan devices continued across the United States. The sudden ban is based on the rapid increase in the number of cases and deaths associated with the rare form of cancer caused by Allergan devices.</p><p>According to the FDA, there have been 573 cases and 33 deaths worldwide. Out of those cases, 481 can be directly attributed to the Allergan Biocell implants. The data from the FDA’s study concludes that out of the 33 deaths, the specific type of implant was known across 13 of the cases, and out of those 13 implants, 12 were manufactured by Allergan.</p><p>The disease in question is called anaplastic large-cell lymphoma, which is a cancer of the immune system. The cancer itself, while not being breast cancer, forms around the site of the implant in the breast. Fortunately, if it is identified early enough, it can be removed surgically, curing most patients for life. However, if left untreated, it can quickly spread through a patient&apos;s immune system and kill them. The condition typically surfaces in implants used for reconstructive surgery following a mastectomy procedure. Despite the lymphoma being incredibly rare, there has been a steady rise in breast implant surgery in the United States. This increase has resulted in roughly 100,000 women receiving reconstructive surgery following mastectomy operations.</p><p><span>If you or a loved one have been affected by this recall, please do not hesitate to contact the team at Wallace and Graham and see how our expert litigation team can help you.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Sources:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p>https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/24/health/breast-implants-cancer-recall.html</p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/breast-implants/medical-device-reports-breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma\"><span>https://www.fda.gov/medical-devices/breast-implants/medical-device-reports-breast-implant-associated-anaplastic-large-cell-lymphoma</span></a></p><p></p><p><a href=\"https://www.allergan.com/news/news/thomson-reuters/allergan-voluntarily-recalls-biocell-textured-brea\"><span>https://www.allergan.com/news/news/thomson-reuters/allergan-voluntarily-recalls-biocell-textured-brea</span></a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/blog/new-plastic-surgery-statistics-and-breast-reconstruction-trends\"><span>https://www.plasticsurgery.org/news/blog/new-plastic-surgery-statistics-and-breast-reconstruction-trends</span></a></p>'

It tried to pass bills in the legislature to block the suits.&nbsp; It created and funded a proxy “grassroots” group, NC Farm Families, to generate sympathy from the public. Lawyers were tailed when they drove to meet families.&nbsp; Clients reported threats and intimidation.&nbsp; During the trial, industry groups sponsored a giant hog rally near the courthouse.<u></u><u></u></p><p>Mona Lisa persevered through it all aided by her talented team of lawyers and staff.&nbsp; &nbsp;Many in her firm lived on the road to try the cases against a defendant with unlimited resources represented by some of the most powerful international defense firms.&nbsp; Her clients had deep roots in their rural communities, only to have their lives changed when giant factory farms with their open-air waste cesspools were built in their backyards.&nbsp; What followed were things no property owner should ever have to endure – the horrible odor, clouds of flies, buzzards circling, trucks leaking filth waking them up in the middle of the night, and kids being teased for smelling like hogs.<u></u><u></u></p><p>A few months before the first trial, the powerful pork lobby worked with the Republican supermajority in the Legislature to pass a law that would have effectively granted the industry retroactive immunity from these suits.&nbsp; But Mona and her team fought it with everything they had, narrowly (by two votes) winning an amendment to exempt these lawsuits from the new legislation so they could fight on.<u></u><u></u></p><p>Working with legendary epidemiologist Dr. Steve Wing, who died before trial but bravely testified on video, and environmental engineer Dr. Shane Rogers, their team showed that there was pig fecal bacteria on the homes and in the air, explaining the sickening smells, headaches, vomiting, respiratory symptoms and other adverse physical symptoms.<u></u><u></u></p><p>Mona obtained critical trial assistance&nbsp;from renowned trial lawyer Mike Kaeske and his firm, and one of the nation’s leading jury consultants, Lisa Blue.&nbsp; This talented team endured five lengthy trials spanning a year winning each unanimously and achieving record-setting verdicts exceeding $500 million. Smithfield has appealed and the battle continues, but the results have already caused positive change in the industry.&nbsp;Mona and her firm are nominated for the second year in a row for trial lawyer of the year.<u></u><u></u></p><p>Team: <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>Attorneys</strong>&nbsp;<strong><a style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #000000;" href=\"mona-lisa-wallace/\">Mona Lisa Wallace</a>, <a style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #000000;" href=\"mark-doby/\">Mark Doby</a>, <a style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #000000;" href=\"john-hughes/\">John Hughes</a>, <a style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #000000;" href=\"daniel-wallace/\">Daniel Wallace</a>, <a style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #000000;" href=\"whitney-wallace-williams/\">Whitney Wallace Williams</a>,&nbsp;and Paralegal Linda Wike, Wallace and Graham, P.A., Salisbury, N.C.;&nbsp;Lynn Bradshaw&nbsp;and <a style=\"text-decoration: none; color: #000000;" href=\"https://kaeskelaw.com/\">Michael Kaeske</a>, Kaeske Law Firm, Austin, Texas; Lisa Blue, Baron &amp; Blue, Dallas, Texas; and Legal Trial Assistant Sophie Flynn</strong>.</span></p>'

  blog: '<p>Wallace and Graham is proud to represent hundreds of North Carolina rural families and property owners in their ongoing claims against the world’s largest hog producer, Smithfield Foods Hog Production Division.&nbsp; The briefs by the families and various nonprofit groups who support them have now been filed with the Appeals Court.&nbsp; To help set these briefs in context, some background on the lawsuits is in order.</p><p>Smithfield Foods is owned by WH Group, China’s largest pork producer.&nbsp; In 2013, WH Group purchased Smithfield and has since reported record profits.&nbsp; Smithfield’s Hog Production Division supplies the hogs that have led to up to $20 billion in revenues.&nbsp; Yet these profits have come at a severe cost.&nbsp;</p><p>For years, North Carolina families who live near the hogs have complained about the effects of the hog production enterprise.&nbsp; They have complained about the truck noise, the leaks from trucks carrying live and dead hogs, the flies, and the horrible fumes and odor.&nbsp; The hogs – which are owned by Smithfield – generate millions of gallons of waste.&nbsp; And the waste gets stored in giant open-air holding ponds, then sprayed on fields.&nbsp;</p><p><img style=\"width: 100%;" src=\"clientuploads/Blog_Images/Picture1.png" alt=\"Waste Sprayer\"></p><p>Many news articles have been published about these problems.&nbsp; And many scientific studies have shown that the germs, bacteria and foul fumes spread into local communities.</p><p>Smithfield grows millions of hogs in the state.&nbsp; Most of the pork leaves the state for sale. Most of the profits go overseas.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the waste stays here.&nbsp;</p><p>After years without change, finally the neighbors sued asking the jury to find that Smithfield Hog Production’s actions have caused a substantial and unreasonable interference in their ability to use and enjoy their properties.</p><p>So far, five cases have gone to trial in Raleigh.&nbsp; The juries in all five cases held Smithfield (which goes by the corporate name of Murphy-Brown) liable.&nbsp; The juries awarded the families money damages.&nbsp; However, the company has now appealed the verdicts.</p><p>On April 29, 2019, the families filed their brief with the Federal Court of Appeals.&nbsp; You can read it by clicking on the link below.&nbsp;</p><p>Scholars and nonprofit groups have also filed briefs.&nbsp; The most recent were filed on Monday, May 6.&nbsp; You can read each of those briefs by clicking on the links below.</p><p>The issues have extended beyond the courtroom.&nbsp; The company has lobbied the legislature to pass industry-friendly bills.&nbsp; The debate has played out in the public arena.&nbsp; The families have sought to publicize their side of the story.&nbsp;</p><p>The company knows that steps can be taken to remedy the problems.&nbsp; The pollution is estimated to add millions of dollars in costs to our healthcare system.&nbsp; And the affected counties are filled with open-air waste lagoons and contaminated soil.&nbsp; If the industry won’t bear the cost, it will ultimately fall on the citizens of North Carolina.</p><p><img style=\"width: 100%;" src=\"clientuploads/Blog_Images/Picture3.png" alt=\"hog waste pond\"></p><p>The company has tried to pit neighbor against neighbor and claim that the families are trying to put local farmers out of business.&nbsp; That is not true.&nbsp; The families did not make a claim against the farmers at trial.&nbsp; They only sought damages from Smithfield Hog Production, the company that owns all the hogs.&nbsp;</p><p>The families believe it is important not just to them, but to all of the citizens of North Carolina, that WH Group and Smithfield be required to take the necessary steps to ensure the long-term sustainability of the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Wallace and Graham will continue to provide updates as these cases proceed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>LINKS:</p><p>&nbsp;</p><ul><li><a href=\"clientuploads/PDF/19-1019_Brief_of_Appellee_-_doc_46.pdf" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">The Plaintiffs’ appeal brief.
