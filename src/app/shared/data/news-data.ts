    body: '<p>ASHEVILLE, N.C. (WLOS) —&nbsp;There have been new developments in Buncombe County&apos;s lawsuit against TeamHealth, the billing service for HCA&apos;s Mission Hospital.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p><b>NEW DEVELOPMENTS</b>&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>On Wednesday, Jan. 17, U.S. District Judge Clifton Corker upheld Buncombe County’s allegations of overbilling and proved enough facts to demonstrate a RICO enterprise, meaning TeamHealth knew the billing codes used for medical services were inflated.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>TeamHealth had moved to strike the class action allegations, but the court also denied that motion. Mona Lisa Wallace, of Wallace and Graham, P.A., is co-counsel for the county.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>“We are very happy to proceed with the next steps in this case," she said.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>In an 18-page Memorandum Order, the judge denied TeamHealth’s motion to dismiss the case, allowing the case to move to its next stage, which will allow attorneys to question TeamHealth managers.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>TeamHealth is physician-founded, physician-led clinician networks providing medical services to communities in need. It does not conduct billing and collections operations, a spokesperson said.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p><b>BACKGROUND</b>&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>On Nov. 22, 2022, Buncombe County brought a lawsuit against medical staffing giant TeamHealth Holdings of Knoxville, Tennessee. The company is owned by Blackstone and provides medical billing services for HCA’s Mission Hospital in Buncombe County.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>The lawsuit alleges that TeamHealth inflated the billing codes used to bill charges for medical services to the Buncombe County Government Group Health Plan. According to Buncombe County, it alleges it overpaid based on those bills.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>The county claims TeamHealth sent bills that used improper “CPT Codes,” for example, using a Level 5 code where only a Level 4 was warranted. Codes are typically ranked in levels from Level 1 to Level 5, with Level 1 being the least expensive. According to the county, by paying the inflated bills the county alleges its health plan was overcharged.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>According to the lawsuit to verify the allegations of the scheme, Buncombe County hired a coding expert who reviewed medical bills for five clients. In each of the five examples, “the CPT code used was higher than the service provided warranted.” Because of that, Buncombe County paid 1.5 to 2.5 times more than if the bill was coded with what it considered to be the proper code.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>In a release from Wallace and Graham P.A. they explained, “In addition to alleging its own claim, the County in its lawsuit seeks to represent a class of all other likewise affected plans and payors in the United States. TeamHealth moved to strike the class action allegations. However, the Court denied the motion to strike.”&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>Former North Carolina Appellate Judge Robert A. Hunter, of Higgins Benjamin PLLC, represents the county in the matter. He stated, "We are pleased the court has ruled in this case and will get to work on discovery in the case."&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>“We are very happy to proceed with the next steps in this case,” Wallace stated.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p>&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p><b>JOIN THE CONVERSATION (3)&nbsp;</b><u></u><u></u></p><p><b>TeamHealth issued the following statement about the ruling:</b>&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p><b><i>We see this latest court ruling as nothing more than a procedural step, and in no way changes TeamHealth’s continued position that this lawsuit is frivolous and without merit. Buncombe County’s campaign attacks clinicians who provide top-quality care to the citizens of Buncombe County when they are the most vulnerable 24/7, 365 days a year. We continue to stand by them and the care they provide with upmost integrity."&nbsp;</i></b> <a href="clientuploads/PDF/BuncombeCountyLawsuit.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click Here to View the Court Document</a></p>',

    body: '<p>SALISBURY, N.C. (<strong><a href="https://www.qcnews.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">QUEEN CITY NEWS</a></strong>) – Four federal judges recently appointed a Salisbury attorney to serve as co-lead on what could be the largest tort in American history.</p><p>Mona Lisa Wallace will be representing tens of thousands of veterans filing claims against the Department of the Navy and the Department of Justice for contaminated water at Camp Lejeune. Veterans and their families consumed this water for nearly 35 years. The water was determined to have high levels of cancer-causing toxins, such as benzene, TCE, PCE, and vinyl chloride.</p><p>“Our firm alone has more than, I would say, 10,000 cases,” said Wallace, a partner and Wallace &amp; Graham, P.A.</p><p>Though a high honor, representing the plaintiffs won’t be easy. In order to receive compensation for her clients, she’ll need to not only prove that they were exposed to contaminated water at the base between 1953 and 1987 but she’ll need to prove that the exposure likely caused their diseases.</p><p>“With the excitement and the honor and the privilege of being named to that position, I recognize what a great responsibility it is,” said Wallace.</p><p>Among the plaintiffs is Jerry Ensminger. He didn’t learn about Camp Lejeune’s water contamination until he saw a local news broadcast in 1997, three years after he had retired from the Marine Corps.</p><p>“They wanted to study these children for birth defects and childhood cancers, particularly leukemia. I dropped my plate of spaghetti on the living room floor,” he said.</p><p>Over 14 years before he saw that news broadcast, Ensminger’s daughter Janey passed away from childhood leukemia. She was nine years old.</p><p>Janey was conceived and carried while Jerry was stationed at Camp Lejeune.</p><p>“Without exception, all the parents that I’ve met during Janey’s illness that had children in the same boat, the first question that came to their mind was, ‘Why?’” said Ensminger.</p><p>Seeing that news report and learning about the troubling levels of toxins in the water at the base answered that question for Ensminger. Since then, he’s spent every day fighting for justice.</p><p>And he’s not the only one.</p><p>“We didn’t hear anything about Camp Lejeune. [We] knew nothing. That all changed when I turned 39, and out of the blue, I was diagnosed with male breast cancer, which is extremely rare for young men, especially young men who didn’t drink or smoke and do not carry the BRCA 1 or 2 breast cancer mutation genes, which I don’t have,” said Michael Partain.</p><p>Partain was also conceived and carried at Camp Lejeune. He only lived there for the first few months of his life.</p><p>He says he didn’t learn about his toxic water exposure until his father turned on the TV one day and saw Ensminger testifying before Congress.</p><p>“That was 16 years ago, and the crazy thing about it is, when I had that conversation with Jerry, he had already been fighting this for ten full years before I even got involved,” said Partain.</p><p>For all those years, lawsuits brought against the Department of the Navy and the Department of Justice were dismissed. But in August of 2022, President Biden signed the Camp Lejeune Justice Act into law, allowing veterans to bring claims against the federal government for possible compensation.Veterans who had previously filed claims that were rejected are allowed to re-file new claims and veterans that file can not lose their VA benefits. Veterans who have already died can also qualify for a claim through their estate’s representative.</p><div class="article-content article-body rich-text "><p>“A significant number, approximately 30 percent of our clients, have already died,” said Wallace.</p><p>Still, Wallace says the Department of the Navy has not offered a single settlement out of the more than 100,000 claims that have been filed. She says that now that counsel has been appointed, things will hopefully start moving more quickly.</p><div class="article-content-cta-group">&nbsp;</div></div>',

    body: 'SALISBURY, N.C. (WBTV) — Local lawyer Mona Lisa Wallace was appointed Wednesday as co-lead counsel for the plaintiffs in litigation centered in North Carolina over contaminated water at the United State Marine Corps base Camp Lejeune. The litigation is based around cancers and other severe illnesses related to the contaminated water. Wallace was appointed by the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina. The proceedings relate to the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022, a bipartisan bill signed by President Biden on Aug. 10, 2022. The law allows qualified individuals exposed to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune between 1953 and 1987 to pursue claims for compensation. During the pertinent times, the water at Camp Lejeune was contaminated with chemicals including benzene, trichloroethylene, tetrachloroethylene, and vinyl chloride. Exposure to these chemicals can cause myriad conditions including kidney cancer, non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma, leukemia, liver cancer, bladder cancer, Parkinson’s disease and others.“It is a great honor and responsibility to be appointed by the court to be able to represent the military families in their progress toward swift and fair justice. I look forward to dutifully carrying out my duties as co-lead counsel,” said Wallace.',

Lewis</span></p><p><span>Mission is the only certified Level II Trauma Center in Western North Carolina. It accepts all trauma patients in the region, making its emergency room one of the nation’s busiest.</span></p><p><span>A 2014 investigation by the&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.tampabay.com/news/health/how-hca-turned-trauma-into-a-money-maker/2169280/"><i><span>Tampa Bay Times</span></i></a><span>&nbsp;using 66,000 Florida&nbsp; trauma patients’ billing records found that HCA’s overcharging for trauma codes was on average $40,000 more than other state trauma centers for injured patients. When it came to severity of injury, HCA patients were, on average, the same as the state as a whole, according to the&nbsp;</span><i><span>Tampa Bay Times&nbsp;</span></i><span>report.</span></p><p><b>Doctors allege non-physicians activate codes</b></p><p><span>In the North Carolina whistleblower complaint, the doctors said unnecessary trauma codes were typically activated by a non-physician, often a physician’s assistant, who was given little time to make an actual assessment.</span></p><p><span>Scott Ramming // Credit: Mission Health</span></p><p><span>Ramming described a meeting in the office of Chad Patrick, the CEO of Mission Hospital, in which HCA Mission announced that it would lower the threshold for activating trauma codes and alerts, according to the lawsuit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Lalor, who provided extensive internal memos from TeamHealth, said that a trauma alert would be activated if a geriatric patient on blood thinner (including aspirin) fell from any height with any sign of head trauma. Lalor considered this instruction too broad.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Trauma alerts were mandated for anyone older than 65 with a systolic blood pressure of 110 or less. Again, the doctors considered this to be far too crude a measure and overly inclusive, according to the complaint. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In one instance, Ramming described an incident in which an 82-year-old patient, who had other medical problems, arrived by ambulance with a scrape on his head, and a trauma alert was needlessly activated.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“This is one of innumerable instances where geriatric patients are given unnecessary trauma designations for absurdly minor injuries, when a more rational approach would be to medically evaluate the patient and determine what the problem is, rather than mobilizing unnecessary resources,” Ramming said. “As is so often the case, in instances like this, this patient was actually medically sick and had no traumatic injuries.”</span></p><p><span>He noted that this patient’s visit to the emergency room occurred on a day when over 40 other patients were waiting to be seen, some for more than five hours. Ramming said these kinds of trauma alerts force other much more ill patients to wait.</span></p><p><span>In another unwarranted trauma alert, a 79-year-old patient arrived after a car accident, but had no injuries, according to the complaint.</span></p><p><b>Allegations of a surge in trauma activations</b></p><p><span>After April 15, 2020, when TeamHealth started delivering contracted services to Mission Hospital’s Emergency Department, the number of trauma activations surged, according to the lawsuit. The doctors said the higher and more lucrative volume of alerts by TeamHealth and HCA Health occurred despite no change in the acuity of the patient population.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>On one busy ER shift in May 2022, Ramming witnessed many medically ill patients getting trauma designations, yet many ending up going home, according to the complaint. When he commented on this to the physician’s assistant who was on duty, the response was “trauma overcalls aren’t a problem for corporate medicine,” according to the complaint.</span></p><p><span>A similar alert that HCA Healthcare and TeamHealth frequently activate is a “sepsis alert,” which triggers many tests and costly treatments. Sepsis is the body’s extreme response to an infection and is life threatening.</span></p><p><span>Ramming described a case of an 85-year-old woman who came to Mission’s Highlands hospital emergency room with cat scratches and was given a sepsis alert. He canceled the tests, which were “not needed for cat scratches, needless to say,” he said.</span></p><p><span>Mid-level practitioners in the emergency department were incentivized to order numerous unneeded or redundant lab tests, including blood samples, urinalysis, laboratory analyses, metabolic panels, CT scans and X-rays, according to the lawsuit.</span></p><p><span>Multiple examples of redundant testing and scanning were in the doctors’ medical records as part of the complaint. In one instance when a patient arrived in Mission’s emergency room a few hours after undergoing urine tests at an urgent care facility, the hospital ordered repeat tests and the full array of sepsis tests. “There was no need for these repeat tests, and the patient was not ill enough to get the sepsis bundle,” Ramming said.</span></p><p><span>He also noted that it was common to over-code patients as sepsis cases because it not only pads the bill for extra testing, but also pools non-septic patients with truly sick ones, lowering the overall mortality rate.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>A blatant example of “how extreme HCA Mission has become in over-ordering tests,” according to the complaint, occurred when a patient who had the jitters after consuming energy drinks was given Lab tests, oxygen, a chest X-ray and an IV.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;“Even a layperson with common sense could explain this patient’s jitteriness,” Ramming said.</span></p><p><span>Unnecessary testing is ordered by physician assistants who perform triage for the emergency room, where they “have only a very limited ability to interview the patient, really examine the patient or spend time with the patient to determine what is really wrong with the patient,” Ramming said.</span></p><p><span>The changes in practices by HCA and TeamHealth are presumably occurring at other large HCA and/or TeamHealth emergency departments, the complaint said. HCA, based in Nashville, is the largest hospital operating company in the US, with more than 180 hospitals.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The doctors also describe a performance metric system put in place by HCA Health that pressures doctors and other non-physician practitioners to see patients more quickly. A chief metric “is generally speed of service,” according to the complaint.</span></p><p><b>“A conveyor-belt, fast food approach”</b></p><p><span>The changes imposed by HCA and TeamHealth “have forced physicians, mid-levels and nurses alike into adopting a conveyor-belt, fast-food approach to emergency medicine, which is counterproductive both for their experience as employees, and for the experience of patients.”</span></p><p><span>The system is also used to rank doctors against one another and set compensation bonuses, according to the lawsuit.</span></p><p><span>Ramming has served as the assistant director of the Asheville Emergency Department. But after HCA and TeamHealth took over and he provided management with an honest report about the problems and poor practices there, he was demoted, according to the complaint. He continues to work at Mission Health. Lalor has retired. Neither doctor would speak with&nbsp;</span><i><span>Asheville Watchdog.&nbsp;</span></i></p><p><span>Other doctors have called Mission’s environment toxic for medical professionals, and&nbsp;</span><a href="https://avlwatchdog.org/how-many-doctors-does-mission-hospital-have-they-wont-say/"><span>many have left</span></a><span>&nbsp;since HCA took over,&nbsp;</span><i><span>The Watchdog</span></i><span>&nbsp;has previously reported.</span></p><p><span>The North Carolina complaint is seeking three times the fraudulent charges to Medicare and Medicaid, civil fines and attorney fees.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Wallace &amp; Graham also are attorneys for two antitrust class-action suits filed against Mission and HCA.

Similar Cases Have Taken Years To Move Forward, Meanwhile, Those Who Claim Harm Are Aging And Dying</em><strong></strong></span>A federal judge brought up the elephant in the room as he concluded a recent hearing in a lawsuit against a Salisbury nursing home owned by a private equity company.&nbsp;</p><p>“I assume the plaintiffs are elderly and infirm,” U.S. District Judge Thomas D. Schroeder said. “It would be nice to resolve this [case] sooner rather than later for the benefit of the parties.”</p><p>Schroeder spoke at a Nov. 10 hearing in a Winston-Salem federal courtroom for&nbsp;<a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NCHN-SNF-class-action-051721.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a lawsuit filed May 17, 2021</a>, that alleges that the Citadel of Salisbury’s owners harmed residents through understaffing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Defendants Simcha Hyman and Naftali Zanziper, principals of the New Jersey-based&nbsp;<a href="https://oxfordfinance.com/news/oxford-finance-provides-64-6-million-credit-facility-to-the-portopiccolo-group/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">private equity company</a>&nbsp;Portopiccolo and owners of more than 30 North Carolina nursing homes, have denied the claims. Their company took over the Citadel in February 2020, and that’s when the severe staffing problems began, the lawsuit alleges.&nbsp;</p><p>The plaintiffs are Citadel of Salisbury nursing home residents Sybil Rummage, 92, described as having Parkinson’s disease, and Betty Deal, 74, bedridden and with severe arthritis, according to the suit filed by the Salisbury law firm&nbsp;<a href="https://wallacegraham.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wallace and Graham</a>. Given the ages of those plaintiffs, Schroeder suggested that the attorneys make some decisions soon on whether to use mediation in the case instead of heading to a June 1 trial.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>“I’m inclined to stay everything for a reasonable time if folks are truly interested in resolving this,” Schroeder said. He asked that lawyers let him know by the next afternoon.But the following afternoon was a federal holiday. Court records show no filing by then and emails from NC Health News to attorneys asking about additional filings were not returned by press time.&nbsp;</p><p>Last week’s hearing concerned the plaintiffs’ claim that the owners of the Citadel of Salisbury should face a class-action suit because their actions affected all the nursing home’s residents as a group and they should be compensated for damages.</p><p>The lawsuit alleges that Hyman, Zanziper and their related entities failed to provide the necessary levels of staff members, required medicine and supplies.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NCHN-SNFs-classactionDefendantsresponse-.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The suit claims that the failures to act</a>&nbsp;occurred when there were COVID-related restrictions on visits to long-term care centers. During that time, residents’ family members were not present to look out for their interests.</p><p>As more private equity firms acquire skilled nursing facilities, often homes that already have a low rating by federal regulators, the North Carolina lawsuit represents just one attempt made by frail elderly residents to fight back against deep-pocketed investors.&nbsp;<a href="https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jama-health-forum/fullarticle/2786442" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Researchers</a>&nbsp;have found that facilities purchased by such investor-owned firms resulted in increased emergency-department visits, hospitalizations of residents with ambulatory care-sensitive conditions, and overall costs to Medicare. A congressional committee&nbsp;<a href="https://skillednursingnews.com/2021/03/house-hearing-scrutinizes-horror-of-private-equity-investment-in-nursing-homes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took a look</a>&nbsp;at results of the trend in 2021.</p><p>The lawsuit also is taking place against the background of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2022/11/02/ncs-low-performing-nursing-homes-to-get-more-federal-scrutiny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a recent announcement from the Biden administration</a>&nbsp;that it would take more stringent steps to prompt improvement in the problem homes called Special Focus Facilities.The Citadel of Salisbury spent almost two years as a Special Focus Facility before closing in June after federal regulators withdrew Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Defendants: Mistakes were made</strong></h4><p>In the suit, lawyers for the plaintiffs allege that facility owners Hyman and Zanziper deliberately understaffed the Citadel of Salisbury to enhance profits.</p><p>Both defendants countered the allegations, filing a 34-page document in June. They denied that either man “acted in breach of any duty, in violation of any laws or engaged in any other alleged wrongful, reckless or wanton conduct that is improper under North Carolina law and deny that any of his conduct proximately caused injury as alleged by Plaintiffs.”</p><p>The owners also claimed they have evidence that their Salisbury nursing home made mistakes that resulted in reporting fewer staffing hours than actually occurred to the federal&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cms.gov/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services</a>, which regulates nursing homes.</p><p>The defendants, Zanziper and Hyman, have become part of a national discussion of the role of private equity in the long-term care industry. The pair have been the subject of negative media portrayals in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/when-private-equity-takes-over-a-nursing-home" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The New Yorker</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.barrons.com/articles/as-the-pandemic-struck-a-private-equity-firm-went-on-a-nursing-home-buying-spree-51596723053" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Barron’s</a>&nbsp;and the&nbsp;<a href="https://wapo.st/3O3DpAk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Washington Post</a>&nbsp;for their takeover and operation of nursing homes. Plaintiffs cited those media accounts as part of the suit as well as resident and staff interviews and state documents.“Because of the Facility’s dire conditions, it is no surprise that the Citadel of Salisbury became the site of one of the earliest and largest COVID-19 outbreaks at any congregate care setting in North Carolina, as confirmed by testing of numerous residents which occurred on April 10, 2020,” plaintiffs’ attorneys said in the suit.&nbsp;</p><p>Following a March inspection, CMS&nbsp;<a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2022/11/02/ncs-low-performing-nursing-homes-to-get-more-federal-scrutiny/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">effectively closed the Citadel of Salisbury</a>&nbsp;by cutting off Medicare and Medicaid payments for resident care. The facility spent 21 months on the Special Focus Facility&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cms.gov/medicare/provider-enrollment-and-certification/certificationandcomplianc/downloads/sfflist.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">list of those receiving increased scrutiny</a>, a who’s who of the nation’s worst-performing nursing homes. One of the state’s earliest COVID outbreaks took place there&nbsp;<a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2020/05/05/coronavirus-today-may-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">when 151 cases were documented by the state by May 2020</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>Eighteen residents subsequently died from the disease.</p><h4><strong>Class action status debated</strong></h4><p>At the Nov. 10 hearing, attorneys for the facility owners, including&nbsp;<a href="https://www.kasowitz.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kasowitz Benson Torres</a>&nbsp;of New York City, and plaintiffs’ lawyers Wallace and Graham, argued over whether the case should be heard as a class action. That meant, plaintiffs’ lawyers said, that the two aging residents, Rummage and Deal, are representative of a larger class of more than 100 residents who suffered similar harm and should also be awarded damages.&nbsp;</p><div class="is-layout-constrained wp-block-group has-secondary-background-color has-background amp-wp-83d9fba" data-amp-original-style="padding-top:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-right:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-bottom:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30);padding-left:var(--wp--preset--spacing--30)"><div class="wp-block-group__inner-container"><div class="wp-block-newspack-blocks-homepage-articles  wpnbha is-grid columns-3 colgap-2 show-image image-aligntop ts-2 is-3 is-landscape  has-text-align-left"><div data-posts="" data-current-post-id="44484"><p>During the hearing, Schroeder posed questions on whether the case met&nbsp;<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/rules/frcp/rule_23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">standards for class action suits under federal law</a>. According to the rules, the class must be assessed for factors including the number of members, their identification with the group, a legal issue common to all members and the suitability of the representatives. Another factor concerns the question of predominance, that is, whether the legal issues common to the group rise above individual cases and are best tried through a class action.&nbsp;</p><p>“The issue of systemic understaffing is sufficiently central and important to predominate over individual issues,” plaintiffs’ attorneys&nbsp;<a href="https://ecf.ncmd.uscourts.gov/cgi-bin/show_temp.pl?file=3408056-0--9056.pdf&amp;type=application/pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a>.</p><p>If the case proceeds to trial on the proposed June start date, instead of possible mediation in January as proposed by Schroeder, more than two years will have passed since the elderly defendants first filed the suit. There’s no predicting how long the wait will be for the original plaintiffs, both in poor health, and whether they’d live to see an outcome.</p><h4 id="h-similar-cases-drag-on"><strong>Similar cases drag on</strong></h4><p>Any residents and families seeking recompense almost certainly have a long road ahead. It’s not uncommon for cases such as these to drag out for years, long enough that original plaintiffs might not live to see any resolution.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NCHN-SNFs-ClassAction-Craven-county.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">A 2018 class action suit against a Craven County adult care home</a>&nbsp;was certified in July in state court, a seeming victory for residents of Lake Pointe Assisted Living, who charged that the center had failed to provide adequate staffing to meet residents’ needs, serve nutritious meals, hold appropriate activities for residents, and make sure the facility complied with laws, rules and regulations for the safe operation of the facility.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the Craven County suit is ongoing in federal and state court. There was a victory for the plaintiffs in July when the federal Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals&nbsp;<a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/NCHN-ClassActioon-Bigler-CravenCounty-FourthCircuit211668.U.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">found that the insurance company for Lake Pointe had to defend the claims</a>&nbsp;against the facility.

Long St.</p><p>By the time every basket was unloaded and stacked together, the couches and tables in the nonprofit’s waiting room were hardly visible. After delivering the baskets, the law firm presented Renee Bradshaw, executive director of Family Crisis Council, with a check for $3,000. Bradshaw was awestruck by the gesture.“It is indeed a wonderful thing that they have done,” Bradshaw said. “The ladies and the children will be greatly appreciative of being able to start out with items they need. It took a lot of work and it means so much to me.”</p><p>Family Crisis Council works to empower victims of rape, sexual assault, incest, and domestic violence to take back their lives.</p><p>The law firm donated the baskets and money through its Wallace &amp; Graham Gives charitable program. The firm says it donates $50,000 annually to a number of local organizations working on causes such as education for underprivileged youth, mental health counseling for veterans, sustainability and more.Wallace &amp; Graham brought the baskets to Family Crisis Council during Sexual Assault Awareness Month, an annual campaign that aims to raise awareness about the causes and risk factors for sexual assault and empower individuals to take steps to prevent it from happening.</p><p>The baskets will be given to victims of domestic violence and sexual assault when they leave the Family Crisis Council’s communal living shelter. The shelter is often the only place many victims have to go after leaving an abuser or dangerous situation.</p><p>“The main purpose of the shelter is to give them a safe haven and then start working with them to move forward,” Bradshaw said.</p><div id="cedato-unit">&nbsp;The baskets are intended to supply victims with products they may need when starting over. Half of the baskets are for mothers and contain items like Clorox wipes, towel sets, blankets, and other hygiene products. The other half are for children and are packed with soccer balls, cups, snacks, and games.<p>“We hope the survivor packages and our donation will help victims of violence feel deeply supported in this community,” said Whitney Wallace Williams, a partner at the firm and chair of the Wallace &amp; Graham Gives committee. “We want to empower victims with the resources and courage they need to end the cycle and to pursue a new ending for their story.”</p><p>The survivor baskets and donations were proposed and executed by Wallace &amp; Graham paralegals Renee Wilcox and Brianna Earnhardt. The two have a special appreciation for the council’s work.</p><p>Wilcox’s father worked in law enforcement as chief of police and her family recognized the impact that a successful women’s shelter has on improving the mental and physical well-being of violence victims. Earnhardt’s mother has spent her career at the Rowan County Department of Social Services and knows how critical victims’ access to resources can be during their deepest times of need.</p><p>The baskets will be another resource the Family Crisis Council deploys to help survivors who leave its shelter. The council also tries to make the process easier by providing mattresses, bedding, and local resources for housing, food and employment.</p><p>“We try to help them with anything they need to get off their feet,” Bradshaw said.</p><p>Temporary shelter for victims is one of the many services provided by the Family Crisis Council. Formerly the Rape, Child and Family Abuse Crisis Council of Salisbury-Rowan, the nonprofit was incorporated in April 1978 and given a grant to develop a service center for victims of family violence. From the time the nonprofit’s first shelter opened in 1990 to December 2016, the Family Crisis Council housed 2,478 women and 767 children in its shelter.</p><p>Family Crisis Council helped more clients last year as documented instances of sexual assault increased. In 2020, there were 179 calls to Rowan County 911 regarding sexual assault and related offenses. In 2021, that number increased to around 226 calls. Last year, Family Crisis Council served a little over 700 clients, including 89 individuals who stayed in its shelter.</p><p>Family Crisis Council operates a 24/7 support hotline for victims and can help people who have been sexually abused with safety planning, housing options, case management, and counseling. The nonprofit helps victims file protective orders electronically and provides court advocates who accompany victims to criminal and civil proceedings.</p><p>“We really work with people from the moment of victimization all the way through the moment we call survivor hood,” said Spencer Dixon, Family Crisis Council’s resource and media coordinator.</p><p>All of the services Family Crisis Council offers are free of charge.</p><p>Family Crisis Council is funded by grants, foundations, governments and individuals.

There are associations with stress and anxiety that we have&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1440786/">studies</a>&nbsp;to demonstrate.”</p><p id="mYO6pb">In the spring of 2020, massive&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/5/1/21239396/covid-19-meatpacking-prison-jail-moral">Covid-19 outbreaks in meatpacking plants</a>&nbsp;shined a spotlight on the daily hazards associated with killing and chopping hundreds to thousands of animals per day: cuts and amputations, dangerous chemical exposure, and repetitive stress injuries.

In theory, these systems are meant to recycle nutrients contained in the waste, like nitrogen and phosphorus, back into crops. But in practice, animal feces and urine regularly&nbsp;<a href="https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10661-020-08433-9">make their way off the farm</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0048969714017641">into the surrounding environment</a>.</p><p>Poultry waste, a dry “litter” that looks like wood shavings mixed with excrement, blood, feathers, and feed, and is usually stored in&nbsp;<a href="https://ncpolicywatch.com/2020/05/18/nearly-a-billion-birds-producing-five-million-tons-of-waste-per-year/">big piles outdoors</a>, can wash away in the rain or blow away in the wind.

Groundwater contamination is an especially concerning problem in rural areas where some&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/11940456/">residents drink well water</a>&nbsp;and where accessing county lines that could provide untainted water costs money people often don’t have.</p><p>“We had wells, but the wells [were] contaminated from the hog farm,” says Delores Miller, a resident who lives just a few hundred feet from a hog CAFO lagoon and sprayfield in Duplin County, North Carolina. “The smell, you can’t hang your clothes out, you can’t do nothing in the yard, and we won’t even talk about the yellow flies.”Children who attend schools near CAFOs in North Carolina experience&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4517575/">higher levels of asthma and wheezing</a>&nbsp;compared to those who attend schools farther from CAFOs, and residents within one and a half miles of CAFOs report&nbsp;<a href="https://ehp.niehs.nih.gov/doi/10.1289/ehp.1205109">elevated blood pressure</a>;&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/21228696/">eye, nose, and throat irritation; difficulty breathing; nausea; and chest tightness</a>, problems that worsen as the odor worsens. One&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/content/79/5/278.full">study</a>&nbsp;found that eastern North Carolina residents who live near factory farms experience higher rates of asthma, anemia, kidney disease, infant mortality, and infections compared to rural residents who don’t live near CAFOs, even controlling for other factors like poverty.</p><p id="S7Eqdi">Though the social and environmental harms wrought by CAFOs are decades old at this point, existing anti-pollution laws provide little relief. The federal Clean Water Act requires the EPA to hold factory farms accountable, but the agency primarily&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-06/documents/compliance-cafos.pdf">regulates</a>&nbsp;only the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/sites/default/files/2015-08/documents/sector_table.pdf">largest CAFOs</a>&nbsp;(for hog farms, that’s CAFOs with more than 2,500 pigs over 55 pounds, or more than 10,000 pigs under 55 pounds). The EPA&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nrdc.org/sites/default/files/cesspools.pdf">allows factory farms to use</a>&nbsp;the problem-prone waste storage and disposal practices described above, and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.foodandwaterwatch.org/2021/06/07/were-suing-epa-again-for-being-too-soft-on-factory-farm-polluters/">doesn’t require</a>&nbsp;CAFOs to monitor the pollutants they release into waterways.</p><p id="iqpcFK">The EPA also leaves much of the enforcement for the regulations that are on the books to state governments, but state agencies often lack the resources or political will to monitor water pollution, and they&nbsp;<a href="https://environmentalintegrity.org/pdf/publications/EPA_State_Failures_Regulate_CAFO.pdf">seldom crack down</a>&nbsp;on violators with any real force.</p><p id="0dzwBy">Air pollution from CAFOs is also largely unregulated; in 2005, the EPA entered into what environmental advocates call a&nbsp;<a href="https://food.publicjustice.net/legal-petition-challenges-epa-inaction-on-factory-farm-air-pollution/">sweetheart deal</a>&nbsp;with thousands of CAFOs, agreeing not to enforce air pollution regulations as long as the meat industry paid for a study of the problem. The EPA planned to use the resulting data to complete an analysis of the industry’s role in air pollution and&nbsp;<em>then&nbsp;</em>begin enforcement. But nearly two decades later, it still hasn’t.</p><p id="Mga8f4">Environmental justice advocates say tight ties between the industry and legislators make progress difficult. “We have legislators that is so deep into the pockets of these dirty industries; they can’t get out, even if they wanted to,” says Naeema Muhammad, senior adviser for the North Carolina Environmental Justice Network.</p><div id="DquAi8"><p id="jh6kOK">Since 2000, meat companies, meat trade groups, and individuals linked to the meat industry have contributed more than&nbsp;<a href="https://www.followthemoney.org/show-me?dt=1&amp;s=NC&amp;f-fc=2&amp;d-ccb=25,156,14,11#%5B%7B1%7Cgro=d-eid">$5.6 million</a>&nbsp;to North Carolina candidates.

Legacies of slavery, genocide, land theft, and racial discrimination have made it impossible for many North Carolinians to access the kind of political and economic power necessary to stop factory farms from moving into their neighborhoods — and from finding relief from the farms’ pollution.</p><p>One historical anecdote highlights how race was a defining factor in the pork industry’s trajectory in North Carolina. Although residents — including many Black, Latinx, and Indigenous people — had been calling for stricter regulation for years, a moratorium on new hog CAFOs passed in 1997 only after a state representative&nbsp;<a href="https://qz.com/433750/the-world-eats-cheap-bacon-at-the-expense-of-north-carolinas-rural-poor/">heard</a>&nbsp;that one was slated to be built near a golf resort and wealthy white community in his district.</p><p id="7UDzBk">Existing CAFOs were grandfathered in, and to this day, factory farms are more common near low-income communities and communities of color. In some parts of North Carolina, there are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncmedicaljournal.com/content/79/5/324">10 times</a>&nbsp;more CAFOs in poor and nonwhite neighborhoods than in wealthier, whiter areas, even controlling for population density.</p><p>Public health researchers and community groups first&nbsp;<a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/095624789600800214">applied the term “environmental racism”</a>&nbsp;to this situation in 1996, when they found an astounding correlation between where formerly enslaved people had settled, known as “the Black Belt,”<strong>&nbsp;</strong>and the modern-day distribution of hog CAFOs in North Carolina. The name stuck, and it continues to resonate with residents who have always known that the distribution of these polluting facilities was not accidental.</p><p id="hUAyvo">Elsie Herring, whose willingness to speak out against the pork industry made her&nbsp;<a href="https://thefern.org/ag_insider/north-carolina-advocate-who-successfully-fought-hog-industry-dies/">the symbol</a>&nbsp;for this fight after a hog farm moved onto her family’s land in the 1980s, often described her battle as one for basic human and civil rights. (She died last year from a form of cancer that may be&nbsp;<a href="https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/34214566/">linked</a>&nbsp;to air pollution.)</p><p>“I definitely think that environmental racism is a big part of this picture of what’s going on with the pork industry,” she told me. “Otherwise, why not put them next door to where they live? Of course poverty has something to do with it also, but there’s plenty of poor white people, and these facilities are not in their neighborhood.”</p><p id="VYIlaM">“Eastern North Carolina is the dumping grounds for North Carolina,” says Muhammad. “We always say whatever white people don’t want in their backyards, come to eastern North Carolina, and we’ll show it to you, ‘cause it’s here.”</p><p id="QTa7Gk">For the past three decades, residents like Herring have been engaged in a multi-front war, supported by a broad coalition of environmental and legal advocacy groups, public health researchers, and civil rights advocates. They’ve executed creative stunts like bringing gallons of hog feces to the governor’s mansion and setting up a mock hog farm — complete with functioning manure sprayers — on the state capitol grounds. They have pleaded with the industry directly, filed petitions, attended council meetings, lobbied legislators,&nbsp;<a href="https://energycommerce.house.gov/committee-activity/hearings/hearing-on-building-a-100-percent-clean-economy-the-challenges-facing">testified before Congress</a>, and even&nbsp;<a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Da%27Quan_Love">run for office</a>&nbsp;against pro-industry politicians.</p><p>They’ve also filed federal Civil Rights Act complaints to the EPA, alleging that North Carolina’s environmental regulatory agency discriminates against communities of color by permitting CAFOs to pollute their air and drinking water (under the Civil Rights Act, no entity that receives federal funds may discriminate on the basis of race).</p><p id="OIBKQt">The most recent&nbsp;<a href="https://thefern.org/ag_insider/epa-to-investigate-north-carolina-biogas-for-discrimination/">complaint</a>, filed in January, argues that regulators are discriminating against communities of color by allowing some CAFOs to convert animal waste into fuel, a practice environmental justice advocates say&nbsp;<a href="https://ncejn.org/biogas/">worsens pollution</a>&nbsp;by entrenching existing systems and subjecting communities to new gas pipelines and plants.</p><p id="64nUqr">For years, North Carolina residents also hoped to find relief by suing the industry, but taking Big Meat to court is neither cheap nor easy. Financial barriers and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/aug/27/it-smells-like-a-decomposing-body-north-carolinas-polluting-pig-farms">intimidation</a>&nbsp;from the industry directed at both law firms and would-be plaintiffs made this tactic inaccessible until residents finally found Mona Lisa Wallace, a gutsy lawyer from a small North Carolina town who was brave enough to take on a meat industry goliath.</p><p id="z8kYbz">In 2014, Wallace’s firm filed 26 nuisance lawsuits on behalf of a group of about 500 North Carolina residents — almost all people of color — against pork producer Murphy-Brown, which later became a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork company. The suits detailed how the odor, noise, and health problems from air and water pollution made plaintiffs’ homes and land less livable and less valuable. The farmers themselves were not named in the lawsuits, as plaintiffs and their attorneys believed that farmers, too, are often&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2020/7/8/21311327/farmers-factory-farms-cafos-animal-rights-booker-warren-khanna">victims of corporate agriculture’s exploitation</a>.</p><p>Five of the lawsuits went to trial, and in each one, jurors unanimously sided with the residents. In total, the juries awarded residents $549,902,400, reduced to $97,880,000 due to a state cap on punitive damages — a cap that was put in place by&nbsp;<a href="https://indyweek.com/news/archives/n.c.-senate-overrides-cooper-s-hb-467-veto-hog-farm-protection-bill-law/">industry-friendly lawmakers</a>.</p><p id="ZVd4Cn">Smithfield appealed, but again, the federal appeals court sided with the plaintiffs, forcing the company to settle all remaining cases. The settlement amounts and other terms of the settlement are confidential, and in its press releases regarding its changes to animal waste disposal practices over the last several years, Smithfield has not stated that those changes are related to the settlement or required by it.</p><p>After the settlement announcement, plaintiff René Miller says conditions haven’t changed for her and her family. “That makes me feel good that we won,” she said. “But because we won, that don’t stop them from spraying [hog manure] on my house. So it’s still going on. I don’t go out my front door, and I stay in the house, keep the window closed. I still smell it.” Miller says she will use what she receives from the settlement to pay her medical bills.</p><p id="fmOYKM">In a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.agri-pulse.com/ext/resources/pdfs/courts/Smithfield-Foods-Statement-Regarding-Appellate-Court-Decision_111920_FINAL.pdf">statement</a>&nbsp;regarding the company’s decision to settle, Smithfield spokesperson Keira Lombardo wrote, “These civil actions brought in North Carolina are part of a coordinated effort by plaintiffs’ attorneys and their allies aimed at dismantling our safe, reliable and modern system of food production. From the outset of these cases, we committed to vigorously defend agriculture and protect North Carolina’s farm families from this assault. Our support for America’s farmers does not end with this decision.”</p><p id="8KQYhH">Despite the win in the courts, while the lawsuits were ongoing, North Carolina’s legislature passed two&nbsp;<a href="https://ncejn.org/2019/06/constitutional-challenge-to-711-467/">retaliatory bills</a>&nbsp;that tamp down on advocacy against CAFO pollution moving forward by making it extremely difficult to sue a major meat company for nuisance. “I think it’s horrific. I think it’s unconstitutional,” says Wallace. “And I think it’s sad that anyone would vote for a bill that treats people differently, that makes some people’s homes more precious than others’, just to protect the industry.”</p><p id="uUJJWT">Before the North Carolina cases, every state already had a “<a href="http://nationalaglawcenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/RTF-Provision-overview.pdf">right to farm</a>” law which protects agribusiness, to a degree, from similar lawsuits. But Big Meat was so spooked by its losses in North Carolina that it has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/thesalt/2019/04/12/712227537/big-ag-is-pushing-laws-to-restrict-neighbors-ability-to-sue-farms">lobbied</a>&nbsp;legislatures in several ag-heavy states to strengthen those laws.</p><p id="LAfxYh">Today, pollution continues unabated in poor communities of color in the state and elsewhere. What’s needed, advocates say, is policy reform.</p><p>The EPA could do a lot more to hold CAFOs accountable for air and water pollution, according to Tarah Heinzen, legal director for the environmental nonprofit Food and Water Watch. “Its authorities under the Clean Water Act, Clean Air Act, and transparency laws remain largely untapped when it comes to CAFOs,” Heinzen says.</p><p id="F6mfYu">An EPA spokesperson told me via email that the agency “has been working toward a comprehensive strategy to address CAFO air emissions” by developing “improved emission-estimating methodologies [and] gathering additional information about the magnitude of CAFO emissions and their control options.” It expects to release draft reports this summer.</p><p>The spokesperson also noted the EPA is evaluating various Clean Air Act regulatory tools that might be used to address air pollution and is working to correct for the injustices wrought by past policies “through active engagement with underserved communities,” with regional&nbsp;<a href="https://www.epa.gov/environmentaljustice/growing-grassroots-building-capacity-environmental-justice-work">virtual workshops</a>&nbsp;and national monthly calls, and by funding air monitoring.</p><p id="XClcQZ">The EPA is also hamstrung by Congress.

    body: 'In this exceptional account, Addison (<em>A Harvest of Thorns</em>) reveals how a cadre of dedicated lawyers and long-suffering North Carolina families fought, and won, against Big Pork. In 2013, attorney Mona Wallace took on the case of 26-year-old Brandon Taylor, who died from toxic fumes while working at a Smithfield packing plant in Clinton, N.C. This case, which ended only in a fine for Smithfield, was the prelude to a series of major environmental nuisance cases. Over the decades, Smithfield, a food corporation giant, had brought five million hogs to four North Carolina counties, polluting the air and water with billions of gallons of hog urine and feces. The rural, mostly Black families who lived near the farms complained about the stench to no avail. Then, starting in 2018, Wallace and her colleagues brought five successive cases to court. Addison dramatically details the massive legal legwork involved, the heartbreaking stories of the families, the courtroom battles, and the intimidation tactics and social media smears by Smithfield. In 2020, after losing an appeal, Smithfield agreed to settle for an undisclosed amount and was forced to change its pork production for the betterment of the people and land of North Carolina. As John Grisham notes in his foreword, this David versus Goliath story has a happy ending. This high-stakes legal saga is a must-read.&nbsp;<em>Agent: Daniel Baror, Baror International.

The lawsuit alleges TeamHealth defrauded the employer and others similarly situated by "deliberately" using inflated Current Procedural Terminology codes, also known as upcoding.&nbsp;&nbsp;"TeamHealth billed using CPT codes appropriate for higher levels of care, when in fact such services were neither appropriate nor provided," the lawsuit alleges.&nbsp;</p><p>In the lawsuit, Louisiana Municipal Risk Management Agency alleges that TeamHealth overbilled 81 percent of its claims and often billed for services rendered by physicians when they were performed by a physician assistant.</p><p>The employer also argues that TeamHealth is structured to make it harder to identify fraud and inappropriate billing as it is made up of more than 100 local subsidiaries. Although the company is split up with local subsidiaries, it has one central billing office that is "controlled in a cartel-like manner," the lawsuit claims.&nbsp;</p><p>"Because TeamHealth uses many different entities and names to carry out its billing scheme, it has been able to mask the enormity of its enterprise and the sheer number of times it has carried out this scheme," the lawsuit reads.</p><p>The employer is seeking class-action status for the lawsuit. The proposed class includes every self-funded payer that has paid for TeamHealth&apos;s services over the last four years.</p><p>The Louisiana Municipal Risk Management Agency is looking to recover damages, restitution and injunctive relief.&nbsp;</p><p>"This lawsuit is almost identical to a frivolous lawsuit filed by the same attorneys last year which was quickly dismissed," Team Health said in a statement to&nbsp;<em>Becker&apos;s Hospital Review</em>. "TeamHealth engages professional coders who follow CMS and American Medical Association guidelines for coding emergency medicine claims. TeamHealth&apos;s coding is subject to a rigorous quality assurance process both internally and externally and is consistent with nationally published database averages."</p>',

The deliberate business model was purportedly orchestrated in a way that made the overbilling undetectable by traditional audit metrics.</p><p>Defendant TeamHealth allegedly used “improperly chosen Current Procedural Terminology (CPT) codes in conjunction with the billing.” The defendant had previously represented to the plaintiff that the codes were true, accurate, and complete. TeamHealth was “upcoding” their CPT codes, charging the plaintiff for higher levels of care when it was not appropriate nor provided.</p><p>The complaint cites a violation of the Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act (RICO), conspiracy to violate RICO, and unjust enrichment. The plaintiff contends that “the scheme defrauded the Plaintiff and similarly situated plans cumulatively of millions of dollars.” As a result of the defendant’s alleged improper and damaging healthcare billing practices, the plaintiffs are seeking class certification, favorable judgment on all counts, monetary damages, equitable and injunctive relief, litigation fees, pre- and post-judgment interest, and any other relief deemed just by the court.</p><p>The plaintiff is represented by<a href="https://parker-crofford.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">&nbsp;Parker &amp; Crofford</a>,<a href="https://wallacegraham.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">&nbsp;Wallace &amp; Graham</a>,<a href="https://www.vandwlaw.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-wpel-link="external">&nbsp;Varnell and Warwick</a>, and Lemmon Law Firm, LLC.</p>',

"Thus, Vidant made it impossible for patients to make an informed financial decision about their care, and patients could not—and did not—willingly consent to pay Vidant&apos;s unreasonable, undisclosed prices."<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4273411895085273250gmail-paragraph-newsletter-5">Vidant said in a statement that the narrative presented in the complaint is inconsistent with its "patient-centered, mission-driven, not-for-profit values."<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4273411895085273250gmail-paragraph-newsletter-6">"In addition to a dedicated team of case managers who help patients understand their bills, set up payment plans and provide charity care in all applicable cases, Vidant has transparent pricing resources available online for any patient or prospective patient to reference," the organization said.<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4273411895085273250gmail-paragraph-newsletter-7">Cansler went to Vidant Chowan Hospital&apos;s emergency room with acute abdominal pain, allegedly because there were no urgent care facilities close to his home and the hospital didn&apos;t have a more appropriate setting to treat him. While he signed a consent form, the term "charges" was not defined, which Cansler and his legal team argued didn&apos;t amount to an agreement to pay the inflated chargemaster prices.<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4273411895085273250gmail-paragraph-newsletter-8">An itemized bill was sent more than a year after the treatment; he paid the minimum as he disputed the charges over that span.

The Medicare reimbursement rate was $315.<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4273411895085273250gmail-paragraph-newsletter-13">Commercial insurers paid hospitals, on average, 247% what Medicare would have for the same services in 2018, according to a RAND Corp.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.modernhealthcare.com/payment/gap-between-what-private-insurers-and-medicare-pay-hospitals-growing" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.modernhealthcare.com/payment/gap-between-what-private-insurers-and-medicare-pay-hospitals-growing&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1645717096076000&amp;usg=AOvVaw1Se8MV5TVK4VnaaVLvQ7h3">study</a>.

Residents are forced to incur these practices because Vidant is the monopoly hospital system for much of&nbsp; Eastern North Carolina.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>According to the complaint, in 2018, George Cansler visited the Vidant Chowan Hospital emergency room for extreme pain from what was likely a kidney stone. More than a&nbsp; year after his visit, Cansler finally received an itemized bill from Vidant demanding he pay $3,119 for a CT scan even after his insurance had already paid $456. The Medicare rate for a CT scan at the time was about $300, meaning that Vidant was demanding to receive more than 11 times the rate of Medicare from Cansler and his insurance company.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The complaint alleges that Cansler had not been told of the price beforehand and that&nbsp; Vidant executives later told Cansler, falsely, that it was a “violation of federal law” for them to disclose prices to patients before care.</span></p><p><span>The complaint alleges that Vidant and FirstPoint Collection Resources, a debt collection company Vidant uses, routinely engage in aggressive and illegal tactics to collect on surprise bills that should never have been issued in the first place. The case asks&nbsp; Vidant to reimburse Eastern North Carolina residents who were overbilled and to halt these deceptive surprise billing and debt collection practices.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The attorneys for Cansler and the proposed class are Fairmark Partners LLP of&nbsp; Washington, DC, Wallace &amp; Graham, PA of Sailsbury, NC, and Professor Barak&nbsp; Richman of Durham, NC.

The soldiers and their spouses are Staff Sgt. Shane Page and Brittany; Spc. Spenser Ganske and Emily;&nbsp;Sgt. 1st Class Christopher Wilkes and Ashley; and Cpl. Timothy Murphy and Katelyn.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The complaint alleges the defendants “conspired to conceal harmful environmental and structural housing defects from unsuspecting service members and their families and failed to comply with applicable building and housing codes” and that they&nbsp;“knowingly leased substandard homes” while “charging grossly excessive rents swallowing up the whole of servicemembers’ basic allowance for housing."&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Attorneys for&nbsp;Corvias&nbsp;and its affiliates&nbsp;have sought to have the case dismissed, stating in legal motions that&nbsp;determining individual claims would require the court to look at the issues at each home to determine what maintenance issues existed, what caused the issues, how long the issues existed, whether the issues affected the home’s habitability&nbsp;if repair work fixed the issues and whether each class member “suffered any damages.”</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Pages started living at a Fort Bragg home on Spear Drive in August 2016 and moved to another home on Baltic Circle in May 2020.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The&nbsp;Ganskes&nbsp;started living at&nbsp;a Fort Bragg home on Castle Drive in&nbsp;September 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The&nbsp;Wilkes family moved into a home in March 2017 on Hirsch Circle and in July 2020 moved to a home off of Viking Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The&nbsp;Murphys&nbsp;lived at&nbsp;a home on Galaxy Street from February 2019 to October 2019, before moving off post.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">On Oct. 30, 2020, lawyers for the defendants asked the court to strike the allegations in the complaint, stating it does not meet the requirements for class certification.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The defense response states that a class-action complaint would require inquiries of tenants of more than 6,000 homes on Fort Bragg.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Plaintiffs’ claims all arise out of these individual allegations, and not from any general conduct directed toward the class as a whole," the response states.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Attorneys filed a Jan. 20 motion on behalf of the defendants seeking to dismiss the case&nbsp;based on requirements for class certification Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23, which requires the plaintiffs to show that the defendants refused to act on grounds that apply “generally to the class” so that final relief “is appropriate respecting the class as a whole.”&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Dever’s Sept. 13 order states that&nbsp;courts generally do not strike class allegations at the pleadings stage and instead allow for discovery before making a certification decision.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“The court has reviewed the amended complaint, the arguments, and the governing law, and the court denies defendants&apos; motion to strike plaintiffs’ class allegation,” he wrote.</p><h2 class="gnt_ar_b_h2">The military families’ claims&nbsp;</h2><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Among the claims, the complaint alleges the&nbsp;defendants&nbsp;leased homes with known problems that caused a “lack of effective moisture and air barriers between exterior cladding and wall cavities in all homes.”&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The problems allegedly caused mold, wood rot and other conditions that threatened the health and safety of the plaintiffs, as workers were allegedly instructed to conceal the defects from tenants, the complaint states.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The complaint alleges that when&nbsp;Corvias&nbsp;entered into its lease with Fort Bragg in 2003, its representatives were aware of an environmental baseline survey of lead paint in 1993.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The information about lead-based paint and its hazards was not provided to residents, the complaint alleges.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The complaint alleges the defendants breached contract obligations, made shoddy repairs, kept misleading records and tenants were threatened with punitive damages if they refused to sign new leases.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The complaint alleges the defendants collected “many millions in fees” for construction, development and management of the homes, with maintenance expenses covered by renters’ base housing allowance.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">“Documents will show that defendants received iron-clad assurances of profit while class plaintiffs lived in slum-like conditions,” the complaint alleges.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The complaint says Page first noticed water damage to his home in September 2016, with&nbsp;Corvias&nbsp;workers allegedly painting over the damage “instead of repairing its cause.”&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In the months following, the home was infested with ants, cracks appeared in walls, the heating and air conditioning ventilation system failed, and most calls for repairs were “tardy and insufficient,” the complaint states.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The complaint alleges mold was found in the home by 2018.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The latest court documents filed Sept. 13 state that the defendants eventually relocated the Pages, “classifying the move as rank eligibility move&nbsp;rather than one caused by the home&apos;s maintenance problems.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When moving into their home on Castle Drive, squirrels were living in the attic of Ganske’s home, with urine soaking through the living room ceiling, the complaint says.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Water intrusion caused mold to grow in the window frame of their daughter’s bedroom.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">There was a large crack in the ceiling that extended down the wall, dirty carpet with nails underneath and electrical outlets in the bathroom not working, the complaint states.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The family stated they submitted work orders but did not receive a response for months, until&nbsp;Corvias&nbsp;representatives told them in April 2019 that their work orders were deleted.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Ganske’s wife found the heating and ventilation system was leaking and covered in mold, with water in the closet and a repairman using a vacuum to remove the water, the complaint alleges.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">With more mold found in the house, Ganske filed a formal complaint with his command.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Corvias&nbsp;sent a contractor to remove the mold, who showed Ganske’s wife the attic soaked in water and allegedly told her he’d seen similar problems in other homes and was not allowed to tell residents mold was present, the complaint states.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When Wilkes and his family moved into their home, they noticed cracked bricks on the exterior, a sagging floor inside and plumbing problems.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The complaint notes a canceled work order for roof repairs, improper work and a leaking bathroom toilet causing more damage to an already sagging bathroom floor.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In December 2019, the roof and inside ceiling collapsed, as one worker fell through.</p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">The complaint alleges maintenance workers told Wilkes they couldn’t promise another home wouldn’t have similar maintenance problems.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">He has filed 33 work orders with&nbsp;Corvias.&nbsp;</p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">The latest&nbsp;legal document states that the defendants&nbsp;eventually&nbsp;<wbr>relocated the&nbsp;Wilkes family and that they’ve had water damage, potential lead-based paint contamination and numerous&nbsp;problems&nbsp;at their new location on Viking Court.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Court documents state that like the other families, the&nbsp;Murphys&nbsp;noticed water damage, wood rot, mold and had issues with appliances.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">It also alleges there was carbon monoxide contamination in the&nbsp;Murphy home, lead-based paint and that certain repair&nbsp;requests for the home were deleted, or “unqualified personnel” were sent for repair work.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Corvias’&nbsp;attorneys&nbsp;wrote that the plaintiffs are making a series of claims “for diverse and distinct maintenance issues,” which attorneys said cannot be answered without individual inquiries of the “unique circumstance” at&nbsp;each of houses when the plaintiffs lived there&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">"Proving that one plaintiff’s house had a particular maintenance issue does not prove that the same issue occurred at any other plaintiff’s house during the course of any other plaintiff’s tenancy,” the attorneys wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Attorneys said though each of the plaintiffs claimed they “experienced issues with mold” or "moisture intrusion,” each cited different causes for the issue, with the Wilkes family attributing it to delayed roof repairs after Hurricane Florence and the&nbsp;Ganskes&nbsp;claiming moisture damage after a heating and ventilation system leak.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">“Proving that mold existed at one house, during one plaintiff’s tenancy, will do nothing to answer whether mold existed at the next plaintiff’s house, or even in the same house at a different time,” attorneys wrote.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">The attorneys denied claims that the plaintiffs engaged in “deceptive conduct” by allegedly counseling or deleting maintenance records and said the plaintiffs would have to prove&nbsp;how they were damaged as a result of the allegations.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Responding to claims that vendors were told not to use the word “mold” around residents when making house repairs, attorneys said in the Jan. 18 motion that claim is an “inflammatory allegation” that would require the court to conduct a “fact-extensive inquiry” to determine whether each class member relied on the alleged statements “to his or her detriment.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><h2>Federal enclave<u></u><u></u></h2><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">In the latest motion filed earlier this year,&nbsp;Corvias&nbsp;attorneys continued to seek , dismissal of the case because they believe&nbsp;Fort Bragg is a federal enclave.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Federal enclaves are territories —&nbsp;such as military installations — where&nbsp;the state gives jurisdiction to the federal government.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Dever’s order states that&nbsp;the court does not need to address the federal enclave doctrine, because the parties’ residential occupancy agreements&nbsp;“contain&nbsp;a choice-of-law provision.&nbsp;“ The agreement states that it will be governed by the laws “of the state which the home is located” and that “the courts of such state&nbsp;have jurisdiction over the name.”&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">“The plain text of this unqualified phrase means that the parties intended that North Carolina laws generally applicable to leased premises would also apply to the leased premises at issue here,” Dever wrote.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><h2>Other court decisions<u></u><u></u></h2><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">The military families&nbsp;allege that under North Carolina law,&nbsp;Corvias&nbsp;and its&nbsp;affiliates violated&nbsp;the&nbsp;North Carolina Residential Rental Agreements Act, North Carolina Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act and Residential Lead-Based Paint&nbsp;Hazard Reduction Act of 1992.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Dever denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss the lead paint claim, stating&nbsp;that the 1992 act requires lessors to disclose to lessees&nbsp;"any known lead-based paint, or any known lead-based paint hazards,” and that Environmental Protection Agency regulations also require the disclosure.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">The defendants argued that the residential occupancy agreements contained the disclosures, but the military&nbsp;families&nbsp;alleged the defendants failed to disclose the presence of the lead-based paint and its hazards before the agreements were signed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Dever&nbsp;wrote that&nbsp;the 1992 act and&nbsp;disclosure&nbsp;rule requires lessors to&nbsp;“affirmatively&nbsp;to disclose the presence of any known lead-based paint and lead-based paint hazards in homes built before 1978, not merely to make reports and records regarding those homes available to lessees."<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Dever denied the defendant’s motion to dismiss the military families’&nbsp;Unfair and Deceptive Trade Practices Act&nbsp;claim.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Citing prior case law, he wrote that the plaintiff does not have&nbsp;to “show fraud, bad faith, deliberate or knowing acts of deception, or actual deception,” but&nbsp;“must&nbsp;show that the acts complained of possessed the tendency or capacity to mislead, or created the likelihood&nbsp;of deception."&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Dever wrote that the plaintiffs alleged the&nbsp;defendants “used deceptive marketing practices to entice customers, manipulated customer survey and service and repair records&nbsp;and misrepresented what repairs were needed to properly fix problems and whether they had made those repairs.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">"Taken as true, this misrepresentation is especially unscrupulous and deceptive,” Dever wrote, adding that the defendants allegedly never showed one of the plaintiffs the home until after a lease was signed.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Dever also dismissed the defendants’ motion to dismiss the military families&apos; nuisance and negligence&nbsp;claims.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">The test for gross negligence, he wrote, is “purposeful conduct and disregard for the safety of others” and the military families “plausibly alleged” the defendant’s “conduct was intentional and&nbsp;disregarded&nbsp;plaintiffs&apos; safety...”&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">Despite the defendant&apos;s arguing that a tenant&nbsp;cannot&nbsp;make a nuisance against his or her landlord and that a&nbsp;private&nbsp;nuisance claim exists when a resident makes improper use of his or her property in a way that injures their neighbor, Dever wrote that in North Carolina, a tenant’s possessory interest is&nbsp;"a sufficient property interest to maintain a claim in nuisance.”.&nbsp;&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class="m_-4736053442767777151gntarbp">“Moreover, nuisance claims are not limited to

    body: 'Mona Lisa Wallace was one of the first asbestos trial lawyers in the Southeast and has handled significant personal injury cases for over 40 years. With partners, Bill Graham and Whitney Wallace Williams, her firm, Wallace &amp; Graham of Salisbury, has assisted thousands of individuals and families who suffer from both accident and occupationally related injuries and illnesses. Her firm has been involved in obtaining some of the largest recorded verdicts in the state.&nbsp;From approximately 1980 through 1992, Wallace was in court almost daily trying cases including civil personal injury. At the same time, she began handling occupational disease cases as that area of the law evolved. She tried one of the first asbestos cases in the Southeast and tried over 80 asbestos claims back-to-back involving a paper mill.Most recently, Wallace &amp; Graham concluded its eight-year journey in North Carolina&apos;s swine farm nuisance litigation. Wallace represented hundreds of rural families suffering from flies, odor, pollutants, and other effects caused by industrialized factory farms. Her team won verdicts of more than $549 million. The verdict in the third trial, in which the jury awarded $473.5 million to six plaintiffs, is said to be the largest in North Carolina History. Smithfield announced the settlement of the litigation in November 2020. Mona and her team won the Public Justice Trial Lawyer of the Year for their work in that case in 2020.Wallace &amp; Graham also worked with co-counsel to obtain what is believed to be the largest wrongful death verdict in North Carolina history- $32.7 million in compensatory damages, affirmed by the Fourth Circuit in Finch v. Covil Corp."I believe my greatest accomplishment is the work my firm has done on improving the working conditions for employees in industrial facilities," Wallace said. "The court decisions and awards the firm has achieved have dramatically improved workplace safety and working conditions of thousands of individuals. By drawing attention to early screening and medical monitoring for the detection of cancers, the firm&apos;s work has helped workers get diagnostic treatment that has saved many lives."Mona and her husband, Lee, are also community philanthropists, supporting several institutions including the Wallace Cancer Center and the Wallace Educational Forum in Salisbury.',

"She wouldn&apos;t eat, she couldn&apos;t do anything," said Tiffany Grzankowski. She tells us Pheonix&apos;s doctor was so concerned that they were sent to the Emergency Room at Mission Health. Grzankowski tells us when they arrived, she felt like the hospital staff wasn&apos;t concerned about her daughter&apos;s condition. "Everything was really looking not good with the labs and nobody could give us answers and it just seemed like nobody at the hospital really wanted to help," said Grzankowski. Grzankowski says after bloodwork, they were sent home, with labs that showed a diagnosis of Hepatitis A. But the next day, Pheonix was still suffering and returned to the ER. Tiffany says once again, they were sent home pretty quickly. She says she later found out the diagnosis given at the hospital wasn&apos;t correct.</p><p>"Then they call from the health department and said no, they didn&apos;t test for Hepatitis A, they tested to see if she had the vaccine," Grzankowski said. "And that&apos;s kind of like, I think my heart just dropped, honestly."So this whole time she was suffering, she was in clear pain, but there was no fluids, no nausea medicine, nothing at all was done. She later learned from her doctor that Pheonix had mono. "They need to do better, they need to do better," Grzankowski said. "It&apos;s not that I&apos;m saying it&apos;s a horrible hospital and I don&apos;t want them here, I just want them to do better." She tells News 13 she&apos;s aware of the recently filed lawsuit and thinks it&apos;s needed to bring change to Mission. Weeks after the incident, Grzankowski tells she was finally able to sit down with Mission Health leaders. “I feel the people with Mission were genuinely apologetic about what happened and took the feedback made to make some real changes," she said. She said Mission plans to put new procedures in place so that what happened to her daughter doesn’t happen again.</p><h2>THE LAWSUIT AND ITS SIGNIFICANCE</h2><p>Tiffany&apos;s experience is echoed in the&nbsp;<a class="themeColorForLinks" href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12MVSCc82L0fwHjrUFg-_JK73TN9OtVgZ/view" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>87-page class-action lawsuit</strong></a>&nbsp;filed against Mission Health. The lawsuit was filed by two law firms, Wallace &amp; Graham and Fairmark Partners LLP. The defendants include HCA Healthcare, HCA Management Services, Mission Hospital, and ANC Healthcare. The six plaintiffs include Will Overfelt, Richard Nash, Jonathan Powell, William Davis, Katherine Button, and Faith Cook. Some of the plaintiffs say the quality of their healthcare has dropped because of Mission&apos;s sale to HCA. Others claim their health insurance premiums have risen because of the company&apos;s monopoly. Overfelt is an Asheville resident who started a&nbsp;<a class="themeColorForLinks" href="https://www.facebook.com/MountainMaladies" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>Facebook group</strong></a>&nbsp;for those concerned about the hospital. In the lawsuit, he says he saw firsthand through his father&apos;s treatment in 2020 that the "quality of care was clearly worse after HCA bought mission". Powell lives in Morganton and says his doctor left Mission because "HCA overwhelmed him with so many patients."</p><p>In the suit, Davis says HCA closed his doctor&apos;s office completely. But besides complaints about how Mission cares for its patients, the class action lawsuit also claims that the hospital has been a growing monopoly for years, resulting in higher healthcare prices for everyone living in the mountains. News 13 wanted to get some perspective on the lawsuit, its allegations, and the likelihood that it will move forward in court. Barak Richman specializes in anti-trust healthcare law and is a law professor at Duke University. He has also been followed Mission Health&apos;s story closely for years.I&apos;ll tell you one thing that&apos;s immediately consequential about this lawsuit, the people of Western North Carolina now know or should know that they pay more than they should for healthcare, that&apos;s part of the complaint.</p><p>The lawsuit walks through Mission&apos;s past, back to 1995. That&apos;s when the hospital merged with the only other major hospital in Asheville at the time, St. Joseph&apos;s Hospital. That move could have violated the anti-trust law, since it created a monopoly with no competition. But, North Carolina passed a special measure allowing the deal - what&apos;s called a Certificate of Public Advantage, or COPA. The lawsuit claims the regulation was supposed to protect patients against higher healthcare costs, but in 2016, it expired. "This, I think proves, definitely both the increase in prices and the subsequent sale to a for-profit entity that the COPA wasn&apos;t a good idea and my reaction was, I&apos;m sad but I&apos;m not surprised," said Richman. The lawsuit claims that even under the COPA, Mission bought more hospitals and practices to "build an unprecedented empire" while hiding the growing cost to patients. According to the lawsuit, a year later, secret negotiations began with HCA.</p><p>"I think the value of Mission to HCA increased dramatically after the COPA ended and that&apos;s just simple economics," said Richman.</p><p>Richman believes that&apos;s when the hospital&apos;s power and prices jumped dramatically. "We have a monopoly that at least temporarily was blessed by the state but then we saw monopolistic, arguably illegal, conduct after the COPA ended," said Richman. The lawsuit includes four counts: Violation of state antitrust law, attempted monopolization, restraint of trade, and injunctive, equitable, and declaratory relief. We asked Richman what he thought the chances were that this lawsuit would move forward and be successful. "I think it depends on what you mean by success," he replied. "I think that the likely course, the most likely course is that there will be some kind of settlement and the devil will be in the details," Richman says Mission could be forced to follow different contract pricing practices, which could send a powerful signal to other hospital monopolies. "What happens in Asheville really could have an impact nationwide," said Richman.</p><p>He goes on to say that any money in the settlement would, in a sense, be less important than any order for the hospital to change its practices.</p><p>"When these lawsuits get settled, there always is an injunctive element," Richman says. "It&apos;s not just that the hospital has to pay for the bad practices of the past, but they have to promise to stop doing things in the future and that could be really significant. The total dollar amount might be significant, but it&apos;s not really about compensating parties that overpaid, it&apos;s more about making sure this doesn&apos;t happen again," he said.</p><p><strong><a class="themeColorForLinks" href="https://wlos.com/news/local/group-of-nc-residents-file-antitrust-lawsuit-against-hca-healthcare" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">GROUP OF NC RESIDENTS FILES ANTITRUST LAWSUIT AGAINST HCA HEALTHCARE</a></strong></p><h2>MISSION&apos;S RESPONSE</h2><p>We asked Mission Health about what happened to Pheonix but were told the hospital couldn&apos;t comment. A spokesperson for the hospital says she also can&apos;t comment on the pending lawsuit. News 13 did receive this statement from Nancy Lindell, a spokesperson for Mission Health: Mission Hospital cares for hundreds of our community members each day and our goal is for each and every person to receive compassionate, quality care. We encourage anyone who has a concern to call our patient experience number at 828-213-1210.</p><h2>SIMILAR LAWSUIT</h2><p>A similar lawsuit was filed against Sutter Health, the largest hospital in Northern California. Before it went to trial, a settlement was reached, and the hospital had to pay $575 million dollars. In addition, Sutter Health was ordered to change some of its practices, including increasing transparency, limiting out-of-network prices, and stopping denying patients access to lower-cost plans. You can read the complete response from California&apos;s Attorney General on the settlement&nbsp;<a class="themeColorForLinks" href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-secures-preliminary-approval-settlement-sutter-health" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>HERE</strong></a>.</p><h2>WHAT&apos;S NEXT?</h2><p>The next step is for Mission to respond to the lawsuit through court. Then, a judge will decide whether the case will move forward.</p>',

They include a patient being told to defecate in the bed because there was not enough staff to help them to the toilet, dramatic jumps in prescription prices, and warnings about unsafe COVID-19 protocols, including a failure to sanitize rooms after infected patients have been intubated.</p><p>The growing concerns have led six Western North Carolina residents to sign on to a&nbsp;<a href="clientuploads/PDF/HCAComplaintasFiled_2021.pdf">class-action lawsuit</a>&nbsp;filed against HCA in August for "restraint of trade and unlawful monopolization" in violation of the&nbsp;<a href="https://ncleg.gov/EnactedLegislation/Constitution/NCConstitution.pdf">state constitution</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncleg.net/enactedlegislation/statutes/html/bychapter/chapter_75.html">laws</a>. In seven of the 18 counties it serves — Buncombe, Macon, Madison, McDowell, Mitchell, Transylvania, and Yancey — Mission controls between 75% and 91% of the local health care market. The lawsuit says HCA used its dominance in the region to drive up prices while cutting costs in ways that compromise patient and employee health and safety.</p><p>The suit was filed in state court on Aug. 10 by Salisbury, North Carolina-based Wallace &amp; Graham — the same firm involved in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.usmesotheliomalaw.com/blog/2020/12/our-big-win-for-north-carolina-residents-verdict-upheld-against-pork-producer/">successful lawsuits against Smithfield Foods</a>&nbsp;over hog farm pollution in North Carolina — and Fairmark Partners of Washington, D.C. The individual plaintiffs are residents of Buncombe, neighboring Haywood, and nearby Burke counties who had to pay more for health insurance because of HCA&apos;s conduct.</p><p>"Mission Health was once the crown jewel of North Carolina&apos;s health care system," Mona Lisa Wallace of Wallace &amp; Graham&nbsp;<a href="antitrust-lawsuit-filed-to-protect-patients-workers-businesses-and-doctors-of-western-north-carolina-from-hca-s-practices/">said</a>&nbsp;a press statement. "In filing this action, the Plaintiffs seek to have HCA live up to its promises of providing quality affordable health care in Western North Carolina."</p><p>J.C. Sadler, vice president of communications for HCA Healthcare&apos;s North Carolina division, pointed Facing South to a&nbsp;statement&nbsp;that said the company "will respond appropriately through the legal process."</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/12MVSCc82L0fwHjrUFg-_JK73TN9OtVgZ/view">87-page complaint</a>&nbsp;acknowledges that Mission Health has operated as a regional monopoly since buying its last significant competitor, St. Joseph&apos;s Hospital in Asheville, in 1995. But it alleges that, since purchasing the system in 2019, HCA has abused Mission Hospital&apos;s unique position as the&nbsp;only regional facility&nbsp;providing certain inpatient services like trauma care to compel insurers and patients to pay exorbitant prices or face losing access to those essential services.</p><p>One of these so-called "all-or-nothing" practices is known as "tying" or "bundling," when HCA refuses to sell its vital inpatient services at Mission Hospital to insurance companies unless they agree to use its facilities for other, non-essential services. These tactics drive competitors out of business, thereby enabling HCA to raise its prices with impunity.</p><p>The lawsuit also alleges that HCA conceals prices from consumers, making it difficult to recognize overbilling. The practice not only fails to comply with a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.healthaffairs.org/do/10.1377/hblog20210311.899634/full/">new federal law</a>&nbsp;requiring hospitals to publicize their price lists but disproportionately hurts people with high insurance deductibles or those without insurance.&nbsp; As State Treasurer Dale Folwell&nbsp;told&nbsp;Asheville-based TV station WLOS, "Secret health care costs have a disproportionately negative impact on the upward mobility of lower and fixed income people in western North Carolina." &nbsp;</p><p>In just one example from the complaint, which is based on numbers drawn from a RAND analysis, HCA charged over twice as much for a C-section delivery in 2020 — $10,077 — as the average amount allowed by all other state hospitals, $4,373. The nonpartisan&nbsp;<a href="https://lownhospitalsindex.org/about/">Lown Institute Hospitals Index</a>&nbsp;ranked Mission Hospital as the&nbsp;<a href="https://lownhospitalsindex.org/hospital/memorial-mission-hospital-and-asheville-surgery-center/">second-worst</a>&nbsp;hospital in the state for ordering unnecessary tests and procedures, giving it a "Value of Care" grade of D minus.</p><p>As a result of practices like these, Mission Hospital was the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.definitivehc.com/blog/top-hca-hospitals-nationwide">second most profitable</a>&nbsp;out of all 211 of HCA&apos;s hospital in 2019, with a net patient revenue of $1.2 billion. It achieved that despite having fewer than half the beds of Houston&apos;s Methodist Hospital, HCA&apos;s top revenue source at $1.5 billion.</p><h2 class="h3">Monopoly&apos;s human costs</h2><p>Wendi Williams, a resident of Asheville for 25 years, knows a bit about medical billing from a brief stint selling health insurance before starting her microbakery, Butterbug&apos;s Baked-to-Order. She has also been an inpatient at Mission Hospital and, along with her husband and mother, is a patient in a family practice owned by HCA.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>"I&apos;ve seen things and noticed things in the past two years with their billing that is just astonishing and — in my opinion — predatory," Williams told Facing South.</p><p>She recently spent hours on the phone with multiple HCA customer service representatives about a $61.85 bill the family practice sent to her mother. First Williams was told that her mother had not signed the form to release information to her supplemental insurance company. Then she was told that the insurer had denied the claim multiple times. She eventually went to the insurer&apos;s online portal and saw it paid the bill two weeks after receiving the initial claim in March 2020 — a full year before the date on the bill that showed up in Williams&apos;s mother&apos;s mailbox.</p><p>"My mother is retired, she&apos;s on a set income. She doesn&apos;t have extra money to give a multibillion-dollar corporation," said Williams, who emailed HCA a scan of the payment record several weeks ago and is still awaiting a response. "It&apos;s like roadblock after roadblock to wear people down so they just pay the bill."</p><p>Another consequence of HCA&apos;s purchase of Mission Hospital in Asheville has been the closure of HCA/Mission-owned clinics and hospital wards in neighboring counties. Residents in these more rural areas shared their experiences since the buyout in&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independentmonitormhs.com/community-events-archive">public meetings</a>&nbsp;in January and February 2020 held by the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independentmonitormhs.com/">independent monitor</a>&nbsp;responsible for ensuring HCA upheld&nbsp;<a href="https://www.independentmonitormhs.com/hca-commitments">15 community commitments</a>&nbsp;it agreed to follow as a prerequisite of acquiring Mission Health.</p><p>One speaker from the rural community of Cashiers, North Carolina, objected to HCA replacing their full-time doctor with a travel physician from Atlanta. "[He] was here two days per week … now that&apos;s been reduced to two days every other week," the speaker&nbsp;<a href="https://6953d107-2bae-4c3d-a042-af970d2bcbe1.usrfiles.com/ugd/6953d1_1688d0b5cde640359c7296161b0302ea.pdf">said</a>. "So we have a doctor four days a month." Another speaker who self-identified as an employee at a non-HCA primary care provider in Transylvania County spoke about how staff reductions and unit closures at Mission&apos;s Transylvania Regional Hospital in Brevard affected the speed of crucial procedures. "I had a stat radiology that I needed done stat," the speaker said. "Five days, it took me to schedule it."</p><p>Staffing cuts have also damaged morale within facilities and were among the factors that led registered nurses at Mission Hospital to vote last September to join the National Nurses Union. They&nbsp;<a href="https://www.beckershospitalreview.com/hr/mission-hospital-nurses-approve-1st-union-contract.html">approved their first union contract</a>&nbsp;in July. In addition to guaranteeing pay raises, it requires the hospital to form a committee made up of a dozen union nurses who will review patient care conditions and suggest improvements.</p><p>But others aren&apos;t sticking around to try to make things better. Honored as one of Mission Health&apos;s&nbsp;<a href="https://blog.mission-health.org/2020/11/13/mission-healths-2020-great-100-nurses/">Great 100 Nurses</a>&nbsp;in 2020, Haley Ramsey posted her&nbsp;<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ztilkmNidoDx5Qj94LYgenbNLHJjDm_t6BUJLd2Bmgs/edit?usp=sharing">letter of resignation</a>&nbsp;on Mountain Maladies after 20 years working at Mission Hospital, most recently in the Mother-Baby Unit. "To experience a nonprofit hospital being taken over by an enormous money-making corporation has been devastating," she wrote, citing understaffing and unsanitary conditions due to cuts in nursing assistant and custodial staff.</p><p>"I am no longer willing to put my license, my reputation, or my physical and mental health on the line for a company that does not care about [its] employees or the community it claims to serve," she concluded.</p><h2 class="h3">Scrutiny of health care monopolies</h2><p>Mission Health&apos;s current monopoly in the region can be traced back to the North Carolina legislature&apos;s passage of a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/documentsites/committees/HSCCONPRHl//09-14-11/COPA%20Presentation%2009-14-11.pdf">Certificate of Public Advantage (COPA) law</a>&nbsp;as part of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncleg.net/Sessions/1993/Bills/Senate/HTML/S9v3.html">Hospital Cooperation Act of 1993</a>.</p><p>A COPA is a legal mechanism that allows a merger between competing hospitals to avoid federal antitrust scrutiny as long as the state determines that its benefits outweigh drawbacks and agrees to step in as a regulator. Today a total of&nbsp;<a href="https://sourceonhealthcare.org/updated-states-with-certificate-of-public-advantage-copa-laws/">18 states</a>&nbsp;have COPA laws, including the Southern states of Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, South Carolina, Tennessee, Texas, Virginia, and West Virginia; five other states nationwide had them but have since repealed them.</p><p>In the 23 years that North Carolina&apos;s COPA law was in effect, Mission Hospital was the state&apos;s only facility to apply for its protection. In fact, the legislature specifically amended the law in 1995 to enable Mission to purchase St. Joseph&apos;s. In exchange for being allowed to operate as a monopoly, Mission&nbsp;<a href="https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/42226/2000111-Certificates-of-Public-Advantage.pdf">agreed to caps</a>&nbsp;on its profit margins, in- and outpatient costs, and the number of local primary physicians it employed. Mission subsequently acquired five other hospitals in the region, bolstering its share of the market.</p><p>Then in September 2015, after sustained lobbying by Mission, the legislature repealed the state&apos;s COPA law. State oversight ended a year later.</p><p>One of the first consequences of the repeal came in June 2017, when Mission&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/10/01/what-you-need-know-mission-blue-cross-nc-dispute/716227001/">terminated its contract</a>&nbsp;with Blue Cross Blue Shield NC, the region&apos;s largest health insurance provider, after negotiations between the two companies broke down. Although the gap in coverage for Blue Cross customers lasted only&nbsp;<a href="https://www.citizen-times.com/story/news/local/2017/12/15/mission-health-blue-cross-nc-new-deal-begins-heres-what-happens-next/948169001/">two months</a>&nbsp;before the companies struck a deal, Mission proved it could demand higher prices for its services — prices ultimately passed down to the insurer&apos;s North Carolina policyholders. Then in 2019 came Mission&apos;s sale to HCA; the COPA terms had previously barred it from being sold to a for-profit system.</p><p>The lawsuit against HCA comes as scrutiny of health care monopolies is on the rise nationwide. In 2017, the Federal Trade Commission began&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/attachments/press-releases/ftc-staff-seeks-empirical-research-public-comments-regarding-impact-certificates-public-advantage/copa_assessment_public_notice_11-1-17_revised_3-27-19.pdf">an investigation</a>&nbsp;into the effect of COPAs in Tennessee, Virginia, and West Virginia on health care prices and access; it&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2019/10/ftc-study-impact-copas">expanded the scope</a>&nbsp;of that investigation in 2019 and will release its findings in the future. Last year, in addition, the FTC&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bradley.com/insights/publications/2020/12/an-active-year-for-health-care-antitrust-enforcement">investigated numerous transactions</a>&nbsp;involving hospitals, and there are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.fiercehealthcare.com/payer/doj-mulls-lawsuit-to-intervene-unitedhealth-change-healthcare-deal-reports">reports</a>&nbsp;that the U.S. Department of Justice is considering bringing suit over Minnesota-based health insurer UnitedHealth&apos;s $8 billion merger with Change Healthcare, a health care analytics and technology vendor based in Nashville, Tennessee.</p><p>North Carolina Attorney General Josh Stein&apos;s office collaborated with the USDOJ in 2016 to file&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jdsupra.com/legalnews/the-latest-doj-announces-settlement-52924/">an antitrust complaint</a>&nbsp;against Charlotte-based Atrium Health, formerly Carolinas HealthCare System, to block it from using all-or-nothing practices to acquire a 50% market share in the Charlotte area. Since no purchases had been made,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/press-release/file/1111451/download">the 2018 settlement</a>&nbsp;simply restricted Atrium&apos;s actions in the future.</p><p>Facing South reached out to Stein&apos;s office about the HCA lawsuit but did not get a response. In&nbsp;a statement&nbsp;provided to WLOS, he said his office is reviewing the lawsuit and "will continue to watch this closely." He also stressed that his office&apos;s oversight of the 2019 sale of Mission to HCA did not extend to quality and value of care.</p><p>Of the class-action lawsuits against health care providers that have been filed in recent years, most target the practice of "surprise billing," or charging patients for out-of-network services at an in-network facility. HCA, in fact, settled a case in Florida that alleged it overbilled car insurance policyholders for post-accident X-rays and CAT scans; that suit was settled for&nbsp;<a href="https://topclassactions.com/lawsuit-settlements/closed-settlements/862704-jfk-medical-center-x-ray-billing-class-action-settlement/">$220 million</a>&nbsp;in 2018.&nbsp;In July 2020, Tennessee-based Envision Healthcare&nbsp;settled out of court&nbsp;for charging patients out-of-network prices for anesthesia services provided at their in-network hospitals.</p><p>A suit out of California that was resolved earlier this year offers insight into what could happen if the HCA suit succeeds. In March, Sacramento-based Sutter Health settled with the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union and state Attorney General Xavier Becerra — now secretary of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services — for&nbsp;$575 million. Accused of overcharging Northern Californians as much as double for certain procedures as Southern Californians, the company&nbsp;<a href="https://oag.ca.gov/news/press-releases/attorney-general-becerra-secures-preliminary-approval-settlement-sutter-health">agreed to</a>&nbsp;increased transparency, regulatory oversight, and an end to all-or-nothing and tying practices.<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="clientuploads/PDF/HCAComplaintasFiled_2021.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">To read the full complaint please click here</a></span></p>',

"The complaint alleges that, through a variety of anti-competitive practices, HCA has overcharged for health care."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Plaintiffs are asking HCA to refund overcharges and to change its practices and restore a fair market for healthcare, he says.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">According to the lawsuit, "The North Carolina Constitution states: &apos;Perpetuities and monopolies are contrary to the genius of a free state and shall not be allowed.&apos; However, from 1995 until 2019, Mission operated its hospital system as a monopoly. In January 2019, HCA acquired Mission and to this day continues to operate it as a for-profit monopoly."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The Mission-St. Joseph&apos;s merger in 1995 left Buncombe and Madison Counties with only one choice for inpatient general acute care, it says, but a Certificate of Public Advantage that protected the system from anti-trust actions was repealed in 2016 "after years of lobbying by Mission executives."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Nancy Lindell, Mission Health/HCA Healthcare NC Division spokesperson, said once the company has been served with the lawsuit, it will respond appropriately through the legal process.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"We are committed to caring for Western North Carolina as demonstrated through more than $330 million in charity care and uninsured discounts we provided&nbsp;in 2020, expansion of hospital&nbsp;services&nbsp;including the opening of the North Tower, a new Pediatric ER, and securing land for a new 120-bed behavioral health hospital," she said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Further, we have invested in our colleagues with onboarding nearly 1,200 new members this year and providing more than $3 million in student loan and tuition reimbursement in 2020."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Mission Health is committed to the health and well-being of every person who comes to us for care and we are proud of our dedicated hospital teams that are facing the many challenges of this pandemic and the exceptional care they have provided to our patients," Lindell said.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Among the plaintiffs is Chef Katie Button, of Katie Button Restaurants and Curate. The suit says that "crushing costs of regular health insurance in the Asheville area, due to HCA/Mission," led her to switch her business to a self-funded format.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The complaint says Button has "paid excessive amounts as a proximate result of Defendants charging supra-competitive prices for healthcare, similar to the other Plaintiffs," and that the administrator of her company&apos;s self-funded plan, Roundstone, has advised that the reason the costs are so high is due to HCA/Mission.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Other named plaintiffs speak of paying "artificially high premiums, co-payments, deductibles, co-insurance payments, and/or out-of-pocket payments not covered by the health plans."&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">One of those is Will Overfelt, of Asheville, an administrator on the Mission Mountain Maladies Facebook page who says in the complaint that the quality of care during his father&apos;s weeklong stay in the hospital in February 2020 "was clearly worse [than] it had been in years past."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Mr. Overfelt noted the rooms were dirty. It was hard to get information. He had trouble getting his father&apos;s pain medications timely," the complaint says.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It says Overfelt noticed a napkin on the floor early on in his father&apos;s hospital room and left it where it was to see if it was really being cleaned. A week later when his father was discharged, the napkin was still there.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">When it comes to prices for care, the lawsuit alleges that HCA routinely charges more than state averages.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">According to a large dataset, it says, "HCA currently charges more than two times the state average for a C-section without complications," a price disparity that only exists "because of the system&apos;s unbridled monopoly power and its status as a &apos;must have&apos; system in Western North Carolina."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The complaint says HCA holds an approximate 90% market share for inpatient general acute care in Buncombe and Madison counties, giving it "free rein to dictate the prices it charges ... while at the same time undermining quality to cut costs."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And across the region, it charges that HCA holds a monopoly market share (70% or more) for inpatient services only in seven counties: Yancey (90.9%), Madison (90%), Buncombe (86.6%), Mitchell (85.4%), Transylvania (78.7%) McDowell (76.4%) and Macon (74.7%).</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">The suit says insurance premiums in counties where Mission operates are substantially higher than the state average and higher than in areas with higher costs of living.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">It says they&apos;re about 50% higher than in Winston-Salem, 55% higher than in Durham, Raleigh or Charlotte, and about 60% higher than in Greensboro.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"Crossing the county line from Rutherford County (in Mission&apos;s self-defined service area) to Cleveland County (outside of Mission&apos;s service area), an individual would see premiums drop immediately by 29%," the complaint says.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">In a conference call with media on Aug. 10, State Rep. Brian Turner and State Sen. Julie Mayfield said they support the lawsuit and applaud the plaintiffs for raising important issues.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"People are glad someone is finally paying attention, and a group of folks had the courage to step up and take on this issue," Turner said, adding that Mission is the region&apos;s largest private employer, impacting many residents&apos; lives and livelihoods.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"This lawsuit is not the be-all, end-all, fix-all of the problem," Mayfield said. "But we do hope it is a strong step in the right direction in addressing many issues and concerns we have heard."</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Both Mayfield and Turner said that in the more than two years since for-profit HCA purchased the hospital system, they&apos;ve not heard from a single patient, physician or staffer who&apos;s had a positive word to say about the changes.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">And while she was generally aware of concerns over rising costs of insurance, Mayfield said she didn&apos;t know until reading the complaint exactly why that is, including Mission and HCA using "its monopolistic power in negotiations with insurance companies" that increased costs for everyone.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">They also used that monopolistic power, she said, in negotiations with physician practices who ended up parting ways with the hospital system, resulting in the area losing dozens of physicians.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"The biggest shock to me is the difference in premiums," Turner said, noting folks in Western North Carolina paying premiums $100 higher than other places.</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"That goes to the bottom line of a family&apos;s budget," he said.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Nashville-based HCA Healthcare&nbsp;<a class="gnt_ar_b_a"

more, and at the time, Stein said the state Justice Department made major efforts to review the deal&apos;s terms to see if the purchase price was fair, whether it adequately protected&nbsp;services, and whether the board was properly constituted.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">"I do think there is a gap, a regulatory gap, and what the fix is for that, we can start having those conversations," Mayfield said.</p<p class="gnt_ar_b_p">She mentioned&nbsp;another Certificate of Public Advantage or a re-examining of the powers of the attorney general or other branch of government to regulate monopolies.&nbsp;</p><p class="gnt_ar_b_p">Another regulatory gap is in the attorney general&apos;s authority to regulate hospital conversions, Mayfield said, noting that one thing she&apos;s heard

    body: '<p>A group of residents from western North Carolina&nbsp;filed a lawsuit Tuesday, Aug. 10, against HCA Healthcare and Mission Health alleging the anti-competitive business&nbsp;practices have driven medical prices up and the quality of health care down in that part of the state.</p><p>HCA is based in Nashville, Tennessee, and is the largest care provider network in the world. The group bought the non-profit Mission Health in 2019 for $1.5 billion, a deal approved by N.C. Attorney General John Stein, despite concerns at the time HCA would scale back access to care because it didn’t have competition in the region.</p><p>The six plaintiffs in the class action suit say that’s exactly what’s happening.</p><p>Mission Health, now HCA, has a dominant market share with about 90% in Buncombe and Madison counties, and 70% to 75% in other western counties. Under current federal anti-trust laws, a monopoly is considered to dominate more than 60% of the market share.</p><p>The plaintiffs, who have private insurance, are alleging the hospital system has been reducing care sites, staffing, and services while hiding behind contracts to shield prices from customers. They say the monopoly means many routine procedures, like c-sections, cost double the state average and drive up people’s insurance premiums. For those on Medicare or Medicaid, the prices are three times that of other areas of the state, often resulting in big surprise medical bills.</p><p>“In the complaint, the plaintiffs allege that an out-of-state corporation has used its market power to cut quality and raise prices, harming doctors and consumers,” said Mona Lisa Wallace of Wallace &amp; Graham. “Mission Health was once the crown jewel of North Carolina’s health care system. In filing this action, the plaintiffs seek to have HCA live up to its promises of providing quality affordable health care in Western North Carolina.”</p><p>According to the filing, HCA reports revenue of $51 billion in 2020, with a net income of $37 billion. The lawsuit alleges HCA wanted to acquire Mission Health specifically for its lack of market competition and has continued to degrade services since the acquisition. The filing cites the N.C. Constitution as grounds for action.</p><p>Article 1, Section 34 of the constitution states: “Perpetuities and monopolies are contrary to the genius of a free state and shall not be allowed.”</p><p>The Trump administration issued an Executive Order in 2019 requiring pricing transparency from hospitals with a civil penalty of up to $300 per day if they do not comply. The Biden administration continued that rule in 2020, increasing the penalty for larger facilities, but most hospitals have been electing to pay the penalty rather than reveal their prices.</p><p>“Rampant pricing opacity in health care purchasing due to the third-party payer system artificially inflates prices and largely leaves consumers out of the purchasing process,” said Jordan Roberts, government affairs associate and health care policy analyst at the John Locke Foundation. “Patients can’t shop for all medical care, but imposing price transparency requirements would inject some price information back into the market. Patients will regain some power over their health care purchasing, and hospitals will again have to compete for patients by providing superior services.”</p><p>Health care pricing transparency has bcome a rallying point for lawmakers, the Department of Justice, and the Department of Health and Human Services. State Treasurer Dale Folwell is leading the charge in a years-long battle with hospitals as part of his responsibility to manage the $3.5 billion State Health Plan for more than 750,000 state employees and retirees. Folwell says that hospitals are withholding their pricing, even from the ones paying the bill.&nbsp; He said that for a state employee earning $40,000 per year, paying for their health insurance premiums costs one week’s pay per month.</p><p>“The hospitals have boycotted those who teach, protect, or otherwise serve our state over this issue,” said Folwell in an interview.&nbsp; “Despite being offered nearly 100% profit they’ve refused to become a clear pricer and want to maintain their secret contracts…. This is not a Democrat issue, or a Republican, a gender, or a race issue. This is about being on the right side of history.”</p><p>As of this publishing, HCA has not responded to a request for comment on the lawsuit. Similar suits have been filed in recent years against HCA in Florida, Montana, California, and other states.<strong>THIS IS A REPOST FROM THE CAROLINA JOURNAL TO SEE THE ARTICLE </strong></p>',

    body: '<p>When the pandemic shuttered most North Carolina workplaces, Bruce Trivett had no way to earn his pay from home.</p><p>Instead, the 58-year-old prison officer worked his regular shifts at Avery Mitchell Correctional Institution in person, rarely venturing anywhere else except to pick up food, his family says.</p><p>By fall, a coronavirus outbreak spread rapidly inside the 800-bed state prison in Spruce Pine. Trivett kept working, taking an inmate who was severely sick with COVID-19 to the hospital and guarding him there, according to his daughter, Heather Ziemba.Soon COVID-19 struck Trivett too, killing him in October.</p><p>After a workers’ compensation claim reached the private company that administers claims for the state prison system, it was turned down. A written denial stated Trivett was not placed at increased risk of getting COVID-19 at work.“It hurts that you have to fight so hard to get any justice,” said Ziemba, who has hired an attorney to appeal the denial.</p><p>In theory, North Carolina’s workers’ comp system is designed to provide financial help to employees or their families after people get hurt or sick at their jobs.</p><p>But for many with good reason to conclude they were exposed to the coronavirus while on the clock, it hasn’t worked out that way. The Charlotte Observer found:</p><p><span class="ng_z_sym_square_bullet">▪&nbsp;</span>From the start of the pandemic until the end of May 2021, 3,468 workers’ compensation claims related to COVID-19 were denied in North Carolina - nearly five times the number that have been accepted, according to data from the state Industrial Commission, which administers workers compensation claims.</p><p><span class="ng_z_sym_square_bullet">▪&nbsp;</span>North Carolina’s workers’ comp laws are among the nation’s least friendly to workers. At least 17 states and Puerto Rico have taken steps to make it easier for employees to prevail in workers’ comp cases involving COVID-19, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncsl.org/research/labor-and-employment/covid-19-workers-compensation.aspx" target="_blank" rel="Follow noopener noreferrer">information compiled by the National Conference of State Legislatures</a>. North Carolina isn’t one of them.<span class="ng_z_sym_square_bullet">▪&nbsp;</span>A bipartisan workers’ compensation bill, which would have helped North Carolinians likely exposed to COVID-19 at work, died last year after business groups lobbied against it. Opponents argued that it would cost employers too much money.</p><h3>WORKERS FACE DIFFICULT FIGHT</h3><p>Valerie Johnson, a lawyer with offices in Durham and Charlotte, is among those who have seen how hard it is for workers and their families to prevail in such cases.</p><p>She has handled cases in which there was strong evidence that employees caught the disease at workplaces such as long-term care facilities, where the state saw some of the most severe outbreaks. Still, she said, the employers and their insurance carriers rejected the families’ workers’ compensation claims.Workers’ comp lawyers say such denials are part of a broader pattern: When N.C. employees catch any sort of debilitating illness on the job, they almost never win compensation without a fight.</p><p>Ed Pauley, a Salisbury workers’ compensation lawyer, has handled hundreds of occupational disease cases over the past 20 years, but could recall just three cases in which the carriers agreed to pay the claims from the outset.</p><p>“We have a joke around here that if a case gets admitted, I don’t even know what paperwork to fill out,” Pauley said.</p><p>Employees who hire lawyers to represent them in such cases often win settlements. But advocates for workers say it shouldn’t be so hard.</p><p>“It’s somewhat disturbing that so many who sacrificed, who made conditions tolerable for many who didn’t have to work in these situations … are having to fight for compensation for the effects of a horrible disease,” said Johnson, the Durham lawyer.</p><h3>NC LAWS LIMIT HELP</h3><p>Passed in 1929, the North Carolina workers’ compensation act was designed as a compromise to balance the needs of employers and their workers.</p><p>Workers generally gave up the right to sue over workplace injuries and illnesses. In exchange, they were supposed to get compensation for medical care and lost wages. The law says those deemed disabled by workplace illnesses and injuries, for instance, are eligible for two-thirds of their average weekly wage.</p><p>If an employee dies from those injuries and illnesses, state law says their families are entitled to a portion of their pay and help with funeral expenses.</p><p>North Carolina’s workers’ compensation laws used to be in line with those of many other states, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/the-demolition-of-workers-compensation" target="_blank" rel="Follow noopener noreferrer">a ProPublica investigation&nbsp;</a>into states that had slashed workers’ compensation benefits. But by 2014, only 10 states had more restrictive laws than North Carolina, ProPublica found.</p><p>The biggest changes happened in 2011, when the GOP-controlled General Assembly reduced workers’ compensation benefits for the most seriously injured employees. Under a previous law, for instance, injured employees who were unable to work could collect workers’ compensation benefits for their lifetime. But the 2011 law limited the duration of temporary disability payments to about nine and a half years.</p><p>Often, it’s not difficult for workers to prove they were injured on the job, lawyers and advocates say. But proving they caught an illness at work tends to be far more challenging.</p><p>Under North Carolina law, employees seeking workers’ compensation for occupational diseases like COVID-19 must clear two hurdles.</p><p>First, they must prove that they likely contracted the illness on the job, not an easy task because employers and their insurance carriers frequently argue that the workers could have caught the illness elsewhere.</p><p>Secondly, workers must show that the risk of catching the disease on their job was greater than that for others in the general public.</p><p>Employers and their insurance carriers rarely concede either of those points when claims are initially filed, workers’ compensation lawyers say.</p><p>After the pandemic struck, a number of states, including Illinois, New Jersey and Vermont, enacted “rebuttable presumption” laws that relieve employees of having to prove that they caught COVID-19 at work. Instead, the burden is on employers to prove that they did not.</p><p>North Carolina made no change.</p><p>“North Carolina hasn’t done anything to make workers’ comp easier to prove during the pandemic,” said Bob Bollinger, a Charlotte workers’ compensation lawyer. “The North Carolina law just isn’t very friendly to employees.”</p><h3>BUSINESS OPPOSED CHANGE</h3><p>Last year, a group of Democrat and Republican state lawmakers introduced a bill that would have made it easier for health care workers, first responders and other “essential service” employees to get workers’ comp if they caught COVID-19 on the job.</p><p>Like the laws enacted in other states,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncleg.gov/Sessions/2019/Bills/House/PDF/H1057v1.pdf" target="_blank" rel="Follow noopener noreferrer">House Bill 1057&nbsp;</a>would have&nbsp;allowed&nbsp;employees to collect workers’ compensation unless employers presented “clear and convincing evidence” that they didn’t catch the disease at work.</p><p>Rep. Raymond Smith, who co-sponsored the legislation, said essential workers who catch the coronavirus shouldn’t have to prove they got it on the job.</p><p>“They’ve put their lives on the line and they’re doing a job most of us don’t want to do,” said Smith, a Wayne County Democrat. “This has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with people. And taking care of people who take care of us.”</p><p>The bill — introduced in May of 2020 and co-sponsored by Republicans Jamie Boles of Moore County and Mitchell Setzer of Catawba County — died in the House health committee last year, following stiff opposition from the state’s business community.</p><p>Soon after that bill was introduced, 24 business and insurance groups sent N.C. lawmakers a letter to register their opposition. Most employers are required by law to purchase insurance to cover workers’ compensation claims, and the premiums are based on known workplace risks, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.crmca.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Workers-Comp-Burden-Shifting-Proposal-is-Unfair-and-Threat-to-System-5.01.20-004.pdf" target="_blank" rel="Follow noopener noreferrer">a white paper&nbsp;</a>accompanying the letter.</p><p>Because the global pandemic was unexpected, those premiums weren’t calculated with COVID-19 claim payments in mind, the white paper stated. For that reason, the business groups argued, the legislation would drive up costs and “cause additional and substantial economic damage to an already struggling employer base.”</p><p>Several of the groups that signed the letter represent some of the state’s largest employers, including the North Carolina Home Builders Association, the North Carolina Pork Council and the North Carolina Healthcare Association. A significant number advocate for companies that employ people who didn’t have the option of working from home.</p><p>The opposition continued into year two of the pandemic. On a web page describing&nbsp;<a href="https://ncchamber.com/2021-legislative-agenda/" target="_blank" rel="Follow noopener noreferrer">its 2021 legislative agenda</a>, the N.C. Chamber vowed to “work to defeat legislation that would create any form of rebuttable presumption around COVID-19.”</p><p>The Chamber did not make any of its staff available for an interview. But in an emailed response to the Observer’s questions, a Chamber spokesperson said: “We believe our position is accurately portrayed on our website.”</p><p>MaryBe McMillan, president of the NC AFL-CIO, said essential workers risked their lives to ensure others had the food, medical care and other services they needed. The state should have recognized the risks they took by offering better workers’ comp protection, she said.</p><p>“I think it’s important for people to understand that the legislature had a chance early on in the pandemic to protect workers and to make it easier for them to get workers’ comp if they got COVID,” McMillan said. “But they refused to do it. And they refused to do it because the business community fiercely opposed it.”</p><h3>‘MY HEART JUST STOPPED’</h3><p>Bruce Trivett doted on his three-year-old granddaughter, Emma. He lived alone in a double-wide trailer just two houses down, off a windy mountain road in Spruce Pine. But before the pandemic hit, he would often spend time with Emma, playing on the porch, showing her how toys worked and letting her wear his “World’s Greatest Granddad” hat.</p><p>“That was his life — his grandchild,” said Ziemba, Trivett’s daughter.</p><p>But as COVID-19 spread, Trivett stopped visiting. He rarely traveled outside his home except for work and for food, because he didn’t want to run the risk of transmitting the virus to others, his daughter said.</p><p>By mid September, a major outbreak hit the medium-security prison where Trivett worked. As of Sept. 11, 100 inmates and three staff members at Avery Mitchell Correctional Institution had active cases of COVID-19, a state prison spokesman told&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mitchellnews.com/local-regional/local-correctional-institution-enduring-covid-outbreak" target="_blank" rel="Follow noopener noreferrer">the Mitchell News-Journal&nbsp;</a>at the time.</p><p>That same month, Trivett told his daughter that he had to take an inmate who was sick with COVID-19 to the hospital and guard him there.</p><p>“I remember that conversation like it was yesterday,” Ziemba said. “My heart just stopped.”</p><p>“I said, ‘Please tell me you were protected,’ ” she recalled. “He said, ‘I wore everything they told me to.’ I just remember praying it was enough.”</p><p>Soon, Trivett developed a fever and a cough and was diagnosed with COVID-19. As it got worse, he had so much trouble breathing he found it hard to talk to his daughter on the phone — even when she called on Oct. 2 to announce the birth of Kaylee, his second granddaughter.</p><p>On Oct. 5, Trivett called an ambulance. Paramedics rushed him to the intensive care unit at Mission Hospital, in Asheville, where he remained until he died. His death certificate confirms that COVID-19 killed him.</p><p>He never got a chance to meet Kaylee.</p><p><a href="https://www.odmp.org/officer/25299-correctional-officer-ii-allen-bruce-trivett" target="_blank" rel="Follow noopener noreferrer">An account of Trivett’s death</a>, which appears on a web page that memorializes fallen officers, said he contracted COVID-19 “while conducting a prisoner transport and guard duty of a COVID-positive inmate.” Ziemba said that information was provided by prison staff members.</p><p>Trivett was one of 18 prison and jail officers in North Carolina who died from COVID-19 in 2020, according to an&nbsp;<a href="https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/state/north-carolina/article251871898.html" target="_blank" rel="Follow noopener noreferrer">analysis of death certificate data</a>&nbsp;by the Charlotte Observer.</p><p>To protect people’s medical privacy, the North Carolina Department of Public Safety cannot comment about individual employees who died from COVID-19, said spokesman John Bull. The agency does all it can to link families of “fallen employees” to services available to them, he said.</p><p>“We are following the laws and procedures established long before COVID-19 tragically took the lives of thousands of North Carolinians,” Bull said.</p><p>Several months after Trivett’s workers’ comp paperwork was filed, Ziemba said she got a call from a woman who worked for the company that administers claims for the state prison system. She informed Ziemba that the claim had been denied, just like every other COVID-related claim had come across her desk, Ziemba recalled.</p><p>“She said because it was a pandemic, you could catch it anywhere,” Ziemba said.</p><p>But Ziemba and her attorney say there’s little doubt where Trivett caught the disease.</p><p>“We’ve got a direct exposure to an inmate at a time when there was an outbreak going on,” said Alan LeCroy, the Morganton lawyer who is representing Ziemba. “We have an individual who was taking the virus seriously in his everyday life.”</p><p>For Ziemba and her family, there is much at stake: When employees die as a result of work-related injuries or illnesses, the workers’ comp law says their families are entitled to two-thirds of the deceased worker’s pay for 500 weeks.</p><p>More than 13,000 people in North Carolina — and more than 600,000 in the U.S. — have died from COVID-19.</p><p>Ziemba wonders how many of their families are going through the same ordeal.</p><p>“It’s hard to know that so many people are having to do what I’m doing,” she said. “My heart breaks for every one of them.</p>',

The lawsuit was filed on Monday in the United States District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. It seeks damages for residents and their families.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2">The lawsuit alleges that nursing home residents at the Citadel Salisbury have had to live with disgusting and unacceptable conditions in their rooms at the facility. Because of severe understaffing, they have had to deal with lack of key medications, lack of nursing assistance, horrible food and unsafe conditions.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2">The lawsuit was filed with a report by Dr. Charlene Harrington, a noted expert in the nursing home area. Her report describes the testimony of a facility worker in December of 2020 that “I still continue to find patients saturated with their urine and sometimes feces. Patients aren&apos;t getting out of bed that normally do get out of bed because of the short-staffed issue.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p2">The complaint describes repeated failures by the facility to give key heart medicines to one of the residents, and that “a staff person had falsely reported on the computerized resident chart” that the resident “had been receiving her medications when, in fact, she had not, because they were out of the relevant medication in question at the facility.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1">The complaint also claims that the Citadel Salisbury is one facility in a chain that now has over 35 facilities in North Carolina. Under a government five-star rating system, this chain only has facilities rated one or two stars for the most part. Today, the Citadel Salisbury is on the “Special Focus” list reserved for the worst nursing homes in America.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1">The complaint alleges that when the new owners bought the nursing home, they sent a letter to families promising to offer their elders “5 star service.” However, at that time, the owners knew that in reality, the official government ratings system had only given this nursing home one star out of five. Today, it has zero stars.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1">Commenting on the lawsuit, lead attorney Mona Wallace stated: “These brave facility residents and their families are not just suing for themselves. They are trying to get relief for all of the other families who have loved ones at the Citadel.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p><p class="p1">Ms. Wallace added, “this for-profit chain has nursing homes in our state going by the names of Accordius, Citadel, and Pelican Health. We have heard stories from families of bad conditions at many of those facilities too. Inadequate staffing conditions like this are unacceptable, but unfortunately occur far too often.”<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></p></blockquote><div class="p1" style="text-align: center;"># # # # #<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></div><div class="p1" style="text-align: center;">For more information contact:<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></div><div class="p1" style="text-align: center;">Mona Lisa Wallace<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></div><div class="p1" style="text-align: center;">John Hughes<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></div><div class="p1" style="text-align: center;">WALLACE AND GRAHAM, PA.<span class="Apple-converted-space">&nbsp;</span></div><div class="p1" style="text-align: center;">525 N.

    body: '<p><span class="s1">From her work with a decades-old law firm and downtown leadership positions to her family’s generous financial contributions to charity and the newly established cancer center, local attorney Whitney Wallace-Williams draws her inspiration from her innate desire to help people.</span></p><p><span class="s1">Wallace-Williams, 39, spent a decade away from home, which included her time at UNC-Chapel Hill, where she obtained a sociology degree in 2004, and Wake Forest University School of Law. She spent a year in Austin, Texas, and even spent some time in France. While in Austin, Wallace-Williams worked at a consumer advocacy organization fighting on behalf of wronged customers.</span></p><p><span class="s1">But she attributes her loyalty to Salisbury, where both sides of her family reside, as the reason she returned and joined the Wallace &amp; Graham law firm in 2008. The firm, founded in 1981 by her mother, Mona Lisa Wallace, addresses litigation across the globe, ranging from worker’s compensation issues to civil cases.</span></p><p><span class="s1">“I grew to realize that Salisbury has everything I need in order to live a fulfilling life: close family connections, the best friends I could ever ask for, a challenging and rewarding career that helps others and a community that I love and feel passionate about,” she said.</span></p><p><span class="s1">Recently, Wallace-Williams joined her mother and Bill Graham by becoming a junior partner at the firm. Her most recent cases have been related to worker’s compensation and civil litigation. Some of Wallace-Williams’ cases have made their way to the North Carolina Industrial Commission, in addition to briefs and arguments made in the North Carolina Court of Appeals and Supreme Court.</span></p><p><span class="s1">Though Wallace-Williams questioned in college which career path would allow her to help people — with personality tests suggesting she be a social worker — joining her parents with a career in law seemed like the natural fit.</span></p><p><span class="s1">“I have an innate desire to fight for the underdog,” Wallace-Williams said. “It’s a natural fit for me because I’m allowed to naturally do what I’m inclined to anyway.”</span></p><p><span class="s1">Wallace-Williams said there are too many cases and clients to name who, over the years, have made a special impact. But gestures such as breakfast and lunch deliveries to the firm, surprise homemade gifts and hugs from clients serve as rewarding reminders of the lives she’s been able to touch. Additionally, Wallace-Williams said she enjoys being able to tell her clients to relax and allow her to “do all the worrying and hard work for them.”</span></p><p><span class="s1">She’s the mother to Annie, 7, and Ella, 4, and wife to Brannon Williams, a U.S. Army Special Forces veteran from Georgia. The running joke in her household, she said, is that her only hobby is community activism. That’s evident with the many hats she wears.</span></p><p><span class="s1">In addition to her work at the firm, Wallace-Williams has also dedicated her time to various local boards and commissions. She’s been a prominent figure on the Downtown Salisbury Inc. Board since 2015, the Empire Hotel Redevelopment Task Force, the Economic Development Committee, and an ongoing downtown beautification project called “Paint the Pavement.”</span></p><p><span class="s1">In addition to their work at the firm, the Wallace and Graham family have contributed funds to the ongoing Bell Tower Green Park project and had a new cancer center with Novant Health named in their honor due to a substantial donation. The Wallace Cancer Center is a 32,000-square-foot-facility that now allows Novant to serve patients locally rather than referring patients to other locations for certain cancer-related treatments.</span></p><p><span class="s1">And with the “Wallace &amp; Graham Gives” program that started in 2020, the family has since provided tens of thousands of dollars to local businesses, frontline workers, local families and the homeless population due to the impact of the pandemic. One arm of the program also provides annually a total of $15,000 in scholarships to six Rowan County high school seniors.</span></p><p><span class="s1">Though the contributions have made a lasting impact on the community, Wallace-Williams said volunteering has given her much in return, including both personal and professional growth. Her favorite part of volunteering is the building of friendships and relationships along the way. Wallace-Williams said she loves the passion among residents of Salisbury, and she’s inspired to serve by her belief in the city.</span></p><p><span class="s1">“I love the intimacy and camaraderie we share living in a small community,” she said. “There are opportunities to make a difference here if someone chooses.”</span></p>',

Bayer inherited the business and the litigation as part of a $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto in 2018.</p><p>The company has said that decades of studies have shown Roundup and glyphosate are safe for human use.</p><p>Wednesday’s settlement would cover future claims brought by individuals who have been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and were exposed to Roundup before their diagnosis. The settlement also includes benefits for people who were exposed to Roundup and develop the cancer in the future.</p><p>Roundup, which Monsanto first brought to the market in 1974, is widely used by farmers across the United States and Brazil, alongside crops that are genetically engineered to withstand the its herbicidal effect.</p><p>Glyphosate will remain on the market. Bayer agreed to seek permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to provide a reference link on labels so consumers can find scientific studies on the weedkiller.</p><p>Under the proposed plan, Bayer will provide $2 billion for a four-year period as compensation and to cover outreach and diagnostic assistance. Future claimants could receive up to $200,000 under the deal.</p><p>The parties can agree to extend the settlement period.</p><p>The company said the settlement amount was disclosed last year.</p><p>The agreement must be approved by U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco.</p><p>Chhabria in June questioned the legality of a prior settlement plan that Bayer proposed, which envisioned creating a panel of scientists who would rule on the viability of claims.</p><p>Under the revised deal, anyone who does not make a claim during the four-year period would then be able to sue in court, according Elizabeth Cabraser, an attorney for the proposed class. She also said anyone diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma who does not like their compensation offer under the class plan can go to the court system and try for a better result.</p><p>In June, Bayer reached a wider $9.6 billion settlement that would resolve the bulk of the more than 100,000 U.S. lawsuits that were already filed over Roundup.</p><p>Bayer’s stock has been battered by the litigation, but also by billions of euros in writedowns, and a bleaker profit outlook, in large part related to the $63 billion Monsanto takeover.</p><p>The group last year announced 9.25 billion euros in impairment charges on agricultural assets and shocked markets by predicting a slight decline in core earnings per share in 2021 on weaker demand by farmers.</p>',

In a 67-page opinion, the Court methodically addressed each of the seven issues Murphy-Brown raised, rejecting nearly all of them. The Court rejected MurphyBrown’s assertions that hog farmers were at fault, and not Murphy-Brown, as well as assertions that recent legislation applied to forbid pending litigation. The Court also rejected arguments that the testimony of a plaintiff expert witness was improperly admitted and the testimony of a defendant expert was improperly excluded. Regarding punitive damages, the Court recognized that the plaintiffs “provided evidence of [Murphy-Brown’s] deliberate corporate policies and evidence that [Murphy-Brown] knew these policies had associated harms.” There was “abundant evidence supporting [Murphy-Brown’s] conscious disregard of the conditions at Kinlaw Farms.” And Murphy-Brown’s “leadership persisted in mandating the culpable practices and participated in political efforts aimed at minimizing regulation of harms known to be associated with [MurphyBrown’s] chosen farming efforts.” The Court acknowledges that while there was ample evidence of Murphy-Brown’s willful misconduct justifying punitive damages, the district court should have limited the applicability of evidence regarding Smithfield’s financial status and remanded the case for new proceedings solely on the amount of punitive damages that should be awarded.</p><p>In his concurrence, Judge Wilkinson discussed how the hog farming industry is vital but required “responsible stewardship” to “account for [the] full impact on all stakeholders.” “Stakeholders do not just include consumers, suppliers, and employees; they include neighbors of hog facilities, children who go to school nearby, medical patients who rely on antibiotics, wildlife and water sports enthusiasts, and many more.”</p><p>Lead appellate counsel, Tillman J. Breckenridge of Breckenridge PLLC stated that he was pleased that “the Court of Appeals recognized that the jury was right – Smithfield willfully and wantonly interfered with our clients’ ability to live comfortably in their own homes.” He added that the decision “vindicates the hard work of the trial team, as the Court rebuked Smithfield and MurphyBrown’s practices.” Mona Lisa Wallace added that “we are thrilled at the positive outcome for our clients and the environment. We are especially glad that the Fourth Circuit recognized that the North Carolina jury got it right.” Lisa Blue noted that “we had faith in the jury systems and in the wonderful jurors who dedicated many weeks to understanding the plight of these North Carolina citizens and we’re delighted to see the jurors’ thoughtful consideration and decisions upheld.” Lead trial lawyer, Mike Kaeske further added: “I’m honored to have represented the most worthy group of clients of my career, and I’m grateful that the Court has so fully recognized the truth of their struggle.”</p><p>For the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal’s full opinion, click here:&nbsp;<span style="color: #0000ff;"><a style="color: #0000ff;" href="https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/191019.P.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/191019.P.pdf&amp;source=gmail&amp;ust=1605977499595000&amp;usg=AFQjCNEyuFRdypvKRk0O-R-QSw4ZjT7TqA">https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/<wbr>opinions/191019.P.pdf</a></span></p>',

Further, they’ve seen the well-being of their families put at risk by companies who’ve allegedly chosen to cut repair and maintenance costs to satiate lenders and investors who were promised “outsize[d] gains.”</p><p>“The rental housing offered by Defendants has been plagued by problems consistent with ‘slumlord’ property management, including water intrusion, mold, mildew, filth, insect pests, broken and unreliable HVAC and appliances, and other issues,” the suit summarizes, describing an ongoing situation in which the defendants have taken full advantage of the fact that military tenants, despite their national security responsibilities, have far less leverage than other property lessees.</p><h3>No leverage for residents under privatized military housing, suit says</h3><p>Private-sector developers and property management groups have assumed the bulk of the responsibility for the construction, renovation, maintenance and repair of roughly 99 percent of domestic military family housing in the United States, the lawsuit relays. Following the passage of the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.acq.osd.mil/eie/FIM/Housing/Housing_index.html#:~:text=Congress%20established%20the%20Military%20Housing,the%20condition%20of%20their%20housing." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Military Housing Privatization Initiative</a>&nbsp;(MHPI) in 1996, a measure sparked by Department of Defense concerns regarding the effect of poor housing on servicemember families, private companies have been allowed to enter into 50-year ground leases with military departments to take on the day-to-day upkeep and management of military housing, according to the suit.</p><p>After a bidding process, the Navy selected defendant Lend Lease in 2005 to renovate, demolish and rebuild military housing at Camp Lejeune, Marine Corps Air Station New River, and Marine Corps Air Station Cherry Point pursuant to an operating agreement and 50-year ground lease, the case says. At present, the defendants collect monthly housing allowances for 12 communities, separated by rank, that comprise more than 4,000 residential units at Camp Lejeune.</p><p>The plaintiffs allege, however, that the defendants have wholly violated their promises to “improve quality of life for service members and their families” and “assume the responsibility for the military family Resident’s housing” at Camp Lejeune, having done neither while allowing housing at the base to deteriorate to unacceptable and unhealthy levels.</p><p>According to the plaintiffs, the contractual promises made by the defendants in their Atlantic Marine Corps Communities guideline and policy documents are false and misleading as the myriad problems with Camp Lejeune’s housing were known to the companies prior to the lease of the properties.</p><p>Unfortunately, under the generic take-it-or-leave-it form leases signed by servicemember tenants at Camp Lejeune, there is no wiggle room in which the price of housing can be negotiated, the case stresses. To that extent, the basic monthly allowances paid as rent to the defendants serve as a guaranteed revenue stream for the companies in that a tenant, unlike one not subject to military housing rules, “does not have the ability to threaten to withhold some or all of his rental payment” as a means of forcing the landlord to address poor conditions, according to the complaint.</p><p>Moreover, the form lease signed by proposed class members prohibits residents from taking any self-help measures outside of an emergency situation and bars a tenant from deducting the cost of repairs they conducted on their own from rent, the lawsuit says.</p><p>It’s within this context that the defendants have failed to address, for instance, mold growth and water intrusion at housing built in the hurricane-threatened “warm, wet, southern climate and environment” of Camp Lejeune, which sits on low-lying lands near the Atlantic Ocean, the plaintiffs illuminate.</p><p>Notwithstanding the geographic location of Camp Lejeune and any environmental factors that may affect the buildings, the defendants are still required to operate and maintain residences at the base “in accordance with their marketing representations” touting first-class residential housing.</p><p>Mold growth aside, the lawsuit alleges more broadly that the harmful housing conditions at Camp Lejeune stem from and have been exacerbated by the defendants’ prioritization of keeping investors happy at the expense of those forced to live at the base.</p><h3>Case describes promises made to investors, broken to military tenants</h3><p>Per the case, the defendants promised private investors “outsize gains” in 2004 and 2005, which the plaintiffs chalk up as incentive enough to cut maintenance costs for Camp Lejeune housing to “unconscionable levels” to keep the companies’ bottom line in the black. Within the last four years, the defendants were aware that service and maintenance was underfunded at the Marine Corps base given they had the ability to compare budgets for Camp Lejeune to other, non-military housing projects.</p><p>A comparison of the two reveals that the need to keep residents of non-military housing happy took precedent given the defendants “could not exploit them as captives to the leases as they were able to do with the military families,” the lawsuit alleges.</p><p>Overall, the defendants’ course of action toward military housing at Camp Lejeune was successful enough to nearly double Lend Lease’s project valuation amid “challenging economic conditions,” the complaint says. In its 2018 report, Lend Lease flexed the performance of its investments in its U.S. Military housing portfolio, with a similar boost occurring again the following year.&nbsp;<b>The lawsuit says the defendants’ gains amount to simple addition by subtraction.</b>&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><p>“This was done by cutting service, repair and maintenance costs, letting housing deteriorate, and causing military families to live in abhorrent conditions,” the plaintiffs argue, describing the conditions at Camp Lejeune under the defendants’ watch.</p><p>According to the suit, the defendants possessed a unique awareness of the substandard housing conditions at Camp Lejeune—including of the mold, electrical, plumbing, insect, water intrusion and HVAC woes plaguing the properties—yet “knowingly and intentionally” leased the houses that they misrepresented as habitable.</p><h3>Allegedly false and misleading tenant surveys, repair data</h3><p>According to the plaintiffs, one tool used for years by the defendants to obscure the pervasiveness of the deterioration within Camp Lejeune housing has been false and misleading tenant surveys that purport to show satisfaction among those living at the base. Lend Lease and Winn conspired to hide their neglect from the government by promoting “resident satisfaction rates that do not accord with reality” and encouraging tenants to believe a complaint against the companies amounted to a complaint against the chain of command, the lawsuit alleges:</p><p>"When surveyed by a nonprofit in 2019 in a study cited by Congress, tenants described a four-to-one ratio of negative to positive experiences at MCB Camp Lejeune. Over 60% of the cohort reported negative or very negative experiences. The categories of complaints tracked those of the Plaintiffs.”</p><p>Similarly, the defendants covered their tracks with regard to the shoddy maintenance at Camp Lejeune by maintaining repair records that were “so unreliable that a proper audit could not be conducted,” the case continues.</p><p>Per the case, the rot within Camp Lejeune housing was discovered only after “investigative reporting, [Governmental Accountability Office] investigation and public outcry” sparked Congressional action. The suit adds the defendants pulled in performance bonuses and incentive payments based on inaccurate satisfaction survey and repair record data.</p><h2>Congress steps in</h2><p>In response to an award-winning investigative&nbsp;<i>Reuters</i>&nbsp;report on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/rbp-npc2019/reuters-series-ambushed-at-home-wins-national-press-club-award-idUSKCN1UL20M" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intolerable conditions faced by military families living at Camp Lejeune and other bases</a>, Congress calendared hearings in 2018, 2019 and 2020 at which testimony was given by residents who, the lawsuit says, “bravely went public despite threats of intimidation and retaliation.”</p><p>During a Senate hearing on the current condition of the Military Housing Privatization Initiative, Lendlease Americas CEO Denis Hickey answered in the affirmative when asked if he would do everything in his power to address the housing issues raised by military families.</p><p>According to the lawsuit, however, the plaintiffs’ experiences reveal that the “unacceptable conditions” persist.</p><p>“These changes necessary to remedy intolerable and unacceptable conditions should have occurred years ago,” the suit reads. “However, Defendants have failed to refund BAH amounts or otherwise compensate servicemember families injured and damaged by the unacceptably poor residential conditions to date. Nor have Defendants offered other remedial measures to servicemember families, such as paying for medical assessment or monitoring for mold-exposed families.”</p><p>Instead, the repair efforts promised to be taken by the defendants since Congress stepped in “boil down to establishing a credible repair, service and maintenance facility, like it has promised before but did not provide, and replacing the unfair and deceptive tenant satisfaction surveys, which it calls ‘customer service analytics.’”</p><h3>Left unsaid: water contamination history</h3><p>Camp Lejeune has been the focal point of proposed class action litigation in the past. Though it goes unmentioned in the lawsuit detailed on this page, the base was the subject of litigation centered on the contamination of groundwater provided by two of Camp Lejeune’s eight water treatment plants.</p><p>The water was contaminated by cancer-causing substances, including industrial solvents, benzene and other volatile chemicals, as a result of the waste disposal practices of an off-base dry cleaning company known as ABC One-Hour Cleaners. In January 2017, the Department of Veterans Affairs finalized without much fanfare a rule allowing potentially thousands of former veterans, reservists and National Guard members, or their surviving spouses, exposed to tainted groundwater at Camp Lejeune to claim a piece of more than $2 billion in government disability benefits.</p><p>ClassAction.org’s September 2017 roundup on the state of Camp Lejeune contaminated groundwater litigation can be found&nbsp;<a href="https://www.classaction.org/blog/camp-lejeune-water-contamination-litigation-heres-where-we-are-now" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">here</a>.</p><h3>Who’s covered by this lawsuit?</h3><p>The lawsuit looks to represent all servicemember tenants based at Marine Corps base Camp Lejeune who have entered into lease agreements with Atlantic Marine Corps Communities LLC for residential housing units from September 18, 2016 to present, along with all authorized adult family member spouses or other occupants.</p>',

    body: '<h3><strong>Investigation Into Citadel Nursing Home Corroborates Concerns About State’s Largest COVID-19 Outbreak</strong></h3><p><strong>THIS ARTICLE IS A REPOST FROM THE SALISBURY POST, YOU CAN FIND THE FULL ARTICLE HERE:&nbsp;</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://bit.ly/2YGKdLZ" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://bit.ly/2YGKdLZ</a></p><p>SALISBURY — On April 14, one resident of the Citadel in Salisbury was found dead around the middle of the day. Both hospice and a local funeral home were notified, but the person named the patient’s responsible party said he wasn’t notified by the facility. Instead, he found out after being contacted by the funeral home the following day.</p><p>The complaint is one of more than 20 substantiated in the state’s latest investigation of the Citadel, a nursing home on Julian Road that’s the site of the state’s largest nursing home outbreak and the cause of a plurality of COVID-19 deaths in Rowan County. The state began an unannounced inspection into the facility on April 25 and completed it May 21.</p><p>The state report says a nurse was instructed to only notify hospice and the funeral home, with the expectation that hospice would notify the responsible party — which could be a daughter, son, family member or other person responsible for a nursing home resident— of the death. Both the facility’s medical director and administrator told state investigators that it would’ve been the facility’s responsibility to notify the family of the death.</p><p>Other complaints in the state investigation report indicate the responsible parties of eight residents at the facility weren’t notified of their loved ones’ positive COVID-19 test results. One responsible party stated that he had been receiving notifications from facility before the pandemic about any changes in conditions for the resident.</p><p>In the state report, Citadel administrator Sherri Stolzfus said “for cognitively intact residents, it was the responsibility of the resident to inform their own responsible parties of the testing results.” However, Stolzfus added that she&nbsp;“acknowledged the facility should have followed the regulations regarding notification of both the resident and the responsible party for the significant change of positive COVID-19 results.”</p><p>The report, conducted by the North Carolina Department of Health Services Regulation, also indicates the Citadel didn’t comply with Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines for mitigating the COVID-19 pandemic until April 10. That contrasts sharply with assurances to the contrary by administrators who spoke to the Post previously. At least 12 residents who had been admitted or readmitted between March 11 and April 3 were not quarantined in a designated area of the facility despite CDC’s guidance to separate new and returning residents from current residents, according to the state report.</p><p>Additionally, the state report indicates the facility failed to fully implement the CDC’s use of face masks for both staff and residents until five days after the guidance was released. The CDC recommended the use of masks on April 2, calling for the use of facemasks for patients and residents who must regularly leave the facility for care as well as all long-term care facility residents when possible.</p><p>The Citadel didn’t mandate masks until April 4 for staff and April 7 for residents. The Post first reported on the presence of the Citadel outbreak on April 9.</p><p>The state report concluded that, “this system failure occurred during the COVID-19 pandemic and had a high likelihood of affecting all residents by placing them at an increased risk of developing and transmitting COVID-19.” The state reports a total of 168 cases at the facility, with 54 being staff and 114 being residents. Rowan officials have reported 154 of those cases are among people who live in the county.</p><p>One resident, according to the state report, returned to the facility on March 12 after a hospitalization. The resident returned to a private room, wasn’t quarantined and died three days later, according to the state’s report.</p><p>In the report, an administrator said the&nbsp;policy for new and returning residents was for them to stay in private rooms, separate from general population halls, for five days before being moved to the general population hall. The administrator was unable to explain why the policy wasn’t followed and why it called for five days and not 14 days.</p><p>Another resident who had been readmitted was positive for COVID-19 and not under quarantine, the report states, adding the resident was not wearing a mask and was being cared for by a nursing assistant who said she also wasn’t wearing a mask.</p><p>Stoltzfus confirmed that from March 19 to April 3 the facility’s corporate policy for COVID-19 related to admissions and readmissions didn’t comply with CDC guidelines. Additionally, another hall that was open wasn’t being used for new and returning residents even though quarantined residents could have been placed there.</p><p>Part of the facility’s plan to resolve the complaints outlined in the recent state report included&nbsp;implementing ongoing conference calls with county health officials three times a week. County health officials advised the facility not to admit new residents until 28 days after the last positive test result, according to the report.</p><p>In late April, the county created a nursing home coordinator position to check in with local nursing homes and help prevent further spread of the virus. Some of the check-ins included calling the nursing homes to ensure they have a plan in place if there is an outbreak, make sure they are properly disinfecting the facilities and determine if they have enough personal protective equipment.</p><p>Local law firm Wallace &amp; Graham has filed two lawsuits against the Citadel since the pandemic. The first focused on the death of a resident who had previously tested positive for COVID-19; it was dismissed “to allow the family to grieve and to get (the resident’s) estate in order.” The second seeks an injunction “to force compliance with regulations and North Carolina law.” It does not seek monetary damages. It includes 14 affidavits, including sworn statements from anonymous staff.</p><p>The firm said the 104-page state report reflects detailed insight into the “intentional and reckless practices at the Citadel Salisbury nursing home which have caused so much heartbreak to so many families and our community.”</p><p>“The report corroborates many of the statements made by brave facility nurses and staff members who spoke out in the sworn affirmations that were filed in Rowan County Superior Court on April 28, 2020 and on May 18, 2020,” Wallace and Graham said in a statement. “The report also corroborates the complaints of the many concerned family members who have loved ones at the facility to this day as well as the complaints raised by family members who have been devastated to lose their loved ones to the COVID-19 epidemic at the nursing home.”</p><p>The law firm also added that the “large, for-profit chain” owns other nursing homes in the state with similar unsafe practices. Accordius Health is the company that oversees the Citadel.</p><p>The Citadel did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the Salisbury Post. But in a previous interview, Stoltzfus, the Citadel administrator since February when Accordius Health became the new owner, said the nursing home started preparing for an outbreak a month before the first positive case. Initial preparation included designating one empty hall as a “respiratory” section, where positive residents were placed and employees could don more protective equipment than what was typically needed. Additionally, Stoltzfus said, as guidance from the CDC and other health experts changed, so did the Citadel’s guidelines.</p><p><em>Contact reporter Natalie Anderson at 704-797-4246.</em></p>',

The purpose of the checks is to help people pay for food, utilities, rent, medicine, and other basic necessities at a time when they have been told to stay home and, as a result, have lost income. &nbsp;</p><p>About 120 million Americans have received stimulus funds. But for reasons that are not clear, four million of those people did not receive checks, but instead received a prepaid card (called the EIP card) from the federal government. The cards were sent out in a plain envelope that didn’t say that it was from the federal government, so quite a few&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2020/05/28/people-are-mistaking-stimulus-payments-junk-mail-or-scam/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">people didn’t realize that this was their stimulus funds</a>.</p><p>Some recipients even&nbsp;<a href="https://www.vox.com/recode/2020/5/29/21274397/coronavirus-stimulus-payments-debit-cards-checks-visa" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">called the Better Business Bureau</a>, their state Attorney General -&nbsp;even the FBI -&nbsp;thinking it was a scam!</p><p>The cards are managed&nbsp;by Money Network Financial, LLC (I wonder if Steve Mnuchin has friends there, or if they do business with Trump corporations?)&nbsp;and issued by Treasury’s financial agent, Meta Bank, N.A. (same questions). The cards also come with&nbsp;fees if one uses them at an ATM outside of Money Network’s network.</p><p>And, in a real affront to consumer rights, the cards also come with a forced arbitration clause;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.eipcard.com/cardholder-agreement" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">look at section 16 of this</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;(There&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;an out for people who receive this card, if they act fast to protect themselves; more on that in a moment.)</p><p>Why does that matter?</p><p>Well, suppose Money Network charges some fees that aren’t allowed by law to some group of people within those four million who received the cards. (This happens all the time with banks in America;&nbsp;consumers are regularly hit with unauthorized fees and fines of various types.) Under the arbitration clause, the people being cheated can’t go to court. They can’t have a jury of their peers, and they can’t bring a class action. They have to go to a corporate-friendly private arbitration company, where private arbitrators are likely to favor Money Network over the consumers.</p><p>Because arbitration is more secretive than court, if Treasury or its private bank contractor Money Network breaks the law, operates illegally, or overcharges people, it’s much less likely that the public will ever learn about it. Also, arbitration tends to restrict the discovery individuals can take, so it’s harder to learn about such things as who ordered or directed illegal actions.</p><p>Suppose, for example, that&nbsp;Money Network cheats 10,000 recipients of stimulus cards by charging them some fee that’s not allowed by the contract, or by law. Because of the class action ban in the forced arbitration clause, all 10,000 of those people would have to separately have noticed the extra fee, they would need to read through the entire fine print contract to figure out if the extra fee was illegal (and how many people do you think read these types of fine print documents?). Then, they would have to separately all figure out how to file a claim in arbitration (and since no lawyer can afford to handle cases for individuals over such small sums of money, they would have to do it alone). Then, they would have to&nbsp;separately fight out the case against the bank. In reality, if two or three of the cheated recipients could successfully pursue their case, that would be a miracle, even if Money Network charged a blatantly illegal fee. In contrast, a class action could get refunds for all 10,000 people.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.publicjustice.net/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Bland-Testimony-to-Subcommittee-on-Financial-Institutions-and-Consumer-C....pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The data establishes</a>&nbsp;that while class actions have often recovered millions of dollars for cheated consumers, only an infinitesimal number of consumers actually go to&nbsp;arbitration.</p><p>There&nbsp;<em>is</em>&nbsp;one good thing here. For those people who received the stimulus cards who read through all the fine print, (<em>or</em>&nbsp;who read this blog post), they can OPT OUT of the forced arbitration clause. It says this: &nbsp;“If you do not want this Arbitration Clause to apply, you must send us a signed notice within 60 calendar days after you receive the Card. You must send the notice in writing (and not electronically) to our Notice Address. Provide your name, address and Card account number. State that you “opt out” of the Arbitration Clause.”</p><p><strong>Please do this! Opt Out and keep your rights! Here’s how to do it:</strong></p><p><em>Write on an envelope:</em></p><p>Money Network Financial, LLC5565 Glenridge Connector NEMail Stop GH-52Atlanta, GA &nbsp;30342</p><p><em>Then, take a piece of paper, and write on it:</em></p><p>My name is [your name]. I hereby opt out of the arbitration clause In the Cardholder Agreement&nbsp;of the EIP card for The Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security Act. My address is [your address]. My Card account number is: [number on your card].Sincerely,[Your signature]</p><p>That’s it! Don’t let Steve Mnuchin and Donald Trump take away your right to a day in court if they, or their banker friends, break the law and cheat you.</p>',

An unknown number have died.

She is now described as being seriously ill.</p><p>Garvin’s family blames the facility and its corporate owner, Accordius Health, for creating “a lethal and growing reservoir” for the outbreak by failing to address longstanding hygienic problems as well as operating the facility with an undersized and unresponsive staff that failed to properly react when the disease slipped inside the nursing home’s doors.</p><p>After failing to protect residents and staff, the lawsuit claims The Citadel and Accordius kept frantic families in the dark for days about the safety of their loved ones.</p><div id="zone-el-103" class="zone-el">&nbsp;</div><p>On April 13, when an emergency room doctor at a nearby hospital called several families to tell them that their loved ones from The Citadel were near death, the families said they did not know their relatives had contracted COVID-19.</p><p>Accordius, which is owned by a New Jersey private equity firm, owns and operates nursing homes throughout North Carolina and the Charlotte region.

Instead, it is “inextricably linked with the population it serves and the insidious nature of how the virus spreads.”</p><p>Salisbury attorney Mona Lisa Wallace, a partner in the firm that filed the complaint, said The Citadel and its owners made the outbreak within its walls almost inevitable.</p><div id="zone-el-104" class="zone-el">&nbsp;”The public records regarding this nursing home facility reflect that unsanitary and unsafe conditions existed even before the virus came to our area,” Wallace said in a statement. “The residents of elder care facilities are some of our most vulnerable citizens.

However, the Citadel, a&nbsp;160-bed facility in Rowan County, “laid the groundwork for the virus to flourish,” the complaint reads.</p><p>Garvin had been living at a different rehabilitation facility, but needed long-term care. That’s how she came to live at Citadel in February. Initially, Garvin lived in the private room she had paid for. But at some point, Citadel staff allegedly moved Garvin, who had a urinary tract infection and a fever, from her normal room to an “apparent ‘quarantine hall,&apos;” according to the complaint.</p><p>A fellow resident on the quarantine hall had tested positive for COVID-19. The facility did not notify Garvin’s family, friends and a caretaker who has power of attorney of her infection or the move. “They were left utterly in the dark as her life was placed in jeopardy,” the complaint reads. Only after Garvin called her son did they learn of the situation. “They sought over and over again to reach the nursing home desk by phone to no avail,” the complaint reads.</p><p>Meanwhile, on April 4, the first Citadel resident was rushed to emergency room and tested positive for the coronavirus, followed by several more residents in the coming days. On April 7, the Novant Health Rowan Medical Center leadership met about the apparent outbreak; the next day emergency room personnel contacted the Rowan County Health Department.</p><p>Three days later, on April 10 all staff and residents were tested, but no one told the Garvin’s family or her power of attorney, the complaint alleges.</p><p>On April 13, a Garvin family member finally spoke to an administrator who said in effect “that corporate was handling this,” according to the complaint. Local staff did not have a copy of information showing who had tested positive or negative. “Only corporate had it,” documents read.</p><p>Finally, on April 15, family and friends learned that Garvin had tested positive. She remains hospitalized and is extremely ill, according to attorneys at Wallace &amp; Graham.</p><p>Earlier this week, 96 residents of the Citadel in Salisbury had tested positive, as well as 17 employees, according to media reports. The number of fatalities is unknown, but according to media reports, there have been at least two.</p><p>Months before Garvin arrived, the Resident Council had complained to inspectors that nursing assistants weren’t cleaning the shower room; nor were they answering call lights for 30 to 45 minutes. Thirteen of 23 residents who attended a January meeting indicated the nursing assistants would enter their rooms, turn off the call lights, but “leave the room without addressing their concerns.”</p><p>Inspectors also found dirty shower rooms, including one with a wadded used washcloth that had dark brown spots.</p><p>An&nbsp;<a onclick="javascript:window.open(&apos;https://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/InspectionReportDetail.html?ID=345286&amp;INSPTYPE=STD&amp;SURVEYDATE=02/14/2019&apos;); return false;" href="https://www.medicare.gov/nursinghomecompare/InspectionReportDetail.html?ID=345286&amp;INSPTYPE=STD&amp;SURVEYDATE=02/14/2019">inspection in February</a>&nbsp;revealed multiple violations regarding plans of care for the residents, medication and a dirty kitchen and food preparation area, which had attracted cockroaches and ants.</p><p>Because of the close living quarters and vulnerability of their residents, nursing homes are prone to disease outbreaks.

The lawsuit is seeking a judgment on two claims: negligence and “gross negligence, willful and wanton, reckless conduct.” The suit seeks a jury trial and compensatory damages, punitive damages, costs and further relief deemed by the court. No specific figure is cited.</p><p>“Accordius Health touts itself as ‘a regional leader in the Southeast for quality, satisfaction and clinical competency in skilled nursing care and rehabilitation’ with facilities located in North Carolina and Virginia,” the lawsuit states. “Accordius holds itself out to the public as having a ‘goal is to improve health and patient-driven care by placing residents at the center of their care. In fact, nothing could have been further from the truth.”</p><p>Accordius Health did not return a request for comment by deadline Tuesday.</p><p>The lawsuit says the Citadel was poorly staffed and supported by its corporate owners. On Feb. 24, the facility received an inspection report from late January showing unsafe and unsanitary conditions.</p><p>The suit claims Garvin “was a lucid and vibrant individual” when she, her family and caretakers placed her in the facility in February. And the family paid $11,000 per month for “a private room and quality care.”</p><p>The lawsuit notes unresolved concerns from resident council meetings about not answering call lights for three months and not cleaning shower rooms after showers for six months. It also alleges a mixture of unsanitary conditions in two of the facility’s shower rooms, including dry skin on a stretcher, gray grout that was colored black in several areas, black particles on a shower floor and walls and shower walls with long streaks of dried white drainage. That’s in addition to a white washcloth with dark brown spots hanging on a shower curtain bar and another wash cloth wadded up and on a shower shelf during another inspection, the suit alleges.</p><p>The suit claims Garvin was moved into another hall after contracting a urinary tract infection and running a fever. She was then placed in a room with a patient who tested positive for COVID-19 and, according to the lawsuit, her friends, family and a caretaker with power of attorney for Garvin were not told about the circumstances, including the urinary tract infection.</p><p>Garvin called her son to express her fears and confusion about what was happening. And the suit claims her loved ones could not reach nursing home staff. The suit claims the facility at this point had already transferred two residents to Rowan Medical Center for critical care due to COVID-19.</p><p>Garvin’s loved ones did not realize the conditions at the facility until reading news stories about the outbreak. They were referred to the corporate office. On April 13, one of her loved ones spoke to an administrator, was referred to the corporate office and told the staff had not been given a list of COVID-19 test results.</p><p>The suit says Garvin’s loved ones were not able to make contact with corporate representatives on April 13 and 14. Last week, Garvin’s caretaker with power-of-attorney privileges spoke to an administrator who advised that Garvin had tested positive for COVID-19. Loved ones were notified Garvin was in a weakened condition on Monday and requested to visit. Garvin’s son was told he and certain others could visit only if they arrived before 4:30 p.m., when the receptionist would leave.</p><p>When family and friends arrived, they were provided with a disposable suit, booties, a facemask and no gloves, the lawsuit states.</p><p>“When they were escorted to the quarantine hall, it was like walking into a death ward,” the suit states.</p><p>The lawsuit makes several claims of negligent behavior, including “the facility, due to the negligence and reckless conduct of the defendants compounded by a lack of funding, staffing, intervention or oversight” moved Garvin to the hall with one or more residents infected with COVID-19 without adequately assessing her, notifying her family and without “considering that she would be far safer if kept alone in her private room or if immediately moved to a hospital facility.”</p><p>The suit cites an opinion column published on salisburypost.com Monday and in the Post print edition on Tuesday by John Bream, head of the Novant Health Rowan Medical Center Emergency Department. The suit noted that Bream also expressed worries about failures to contact the family of a patient that tested positive for COVID-19. That patient died the next day.</p><p>Bream wrote that another patient from the Citadel was critically ill with COVID-19 and that he had to connect the patient’s daughter via video conference app FaceTime to spend a final moment with her father, who died 18 hours later.</p><p>Bream said a hospital nursing staff member had family at the Citadel and also had not been notified about the outbreak.</p><p>The suit also notes the apparent financial resources of the companies in charge of the facility, Accordius Health and its parent company the Portpiccolo Group, which does business in New Jersey and the greater New York area. That includes a $36.9 million deal in September with Capital Funding LLC to take over day-to-day operations of facilities in Virginia and Maryland.</p><p>“Our firm is very concerned regarding the issues exposed by the facts that are known in this case,” said Mona Wallace, of Wallace and Graham, in a statement provided to the Post.&nbsp; “The public records regarding this nursing home facility reflect that unsanitary and unsafe conditions existed even before the virus came to our area.&nbsp; The residents of elder care facilities are some of our most vulnerable citizens.&nbsp; They deserve much better. &nbsp;Not only the residents, but their family members, friends, the staff, and physicians have all been exposed and put in jeopardy because of what has occurred.&nbsp; We believe the company should have done much more to anticipate and guard against the COVID-19 virus before it was too late.”</p>',

    body: '<p>Attorneys for a subsidiary of Smithfield Foods, the world’s largest pork producer, went before the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals Friday and asked three judges to overturn a $3.25 million jury award in a lawsuit filed by neighbors of a large North Carolina hog farm.</p><p>During the hearing, they received a sharp lecture from the bench about environmental justice and economic fairness.</p><p>The Virginia-based food company was appealing the first in a series of verdicts holding its hog-production subsidiary, formerly known as Murphy-Brown, responsible for the odor, flies, buzzards, and heavy truck traffic that neighbors said prevented them from enjoying their homes. In five trials in 2018 and 2019, held at the U.S. District Court in Raleigh, juries awarded 36 plaintiffs a total of almost $550 million. The court reduced the awards to about $98 million because of a state law limiting punitive damages.</p><p>The case before the Fourth Circuit,&nbsp;<i>McKiver et al. v. Murphy-Brown,&nbsp;</i>involved 10 residents of White Oak, a rural community in Bladen County, between Fayetteville and Wilmington. In the mid-1990s, a farmer named Billy Kinlaw bought property near their homes and started a hog operation that was permitted to house more than 14,000 animals at a time. Smithfield’s Murphy-Brown subsidiary owned the pigs and contracted with Kinlaw to raise them.</p><p>Like many North Carolina hog farmers, Kinlaw disposed of the pigs’ feces and urine by flushing it from the barns, which house hundreds of animals, into open lagoons, and then sprayed the waste onto his fields as fertilizer.</p><div id="zone-el-102" class="zone-el">&nbsp;</div><p>In their legal complaint, the plaintiffs alleged that Kinlaw’s farm generated a “noxious and sickening odor” that nauseated them and made their eyes sting. Forced indoors, they claimed, they could no longer garden, hold cookouts, or even keep their windows open. Smithfield’s subsidiary “has the resources to eliminate the nuisance,” the complaint said.</p><p>During Friday’s oral arguments, in a Richmond courtroom, Murphy-Brown defense attorney Stuart Raphael called the awards in the&nbsp;<i>McKiver</i>&nbsp;case excessive and the nuisance caused by his client minimal. “The odor is not as they claim it is,” Raphael told the three-judge appellate panel.</p><p>In North Carolina, juries can award punitive damages for “willful and wanton conduct” that disregards the rights and safety of others. The&nbsp;<i>McKiver&nbsp;</i>jury in April 2018 awarded the 10 plaintiffs, including Joyce McKiver, a total of $750,000 in actual damages and $50 million in punitive damages. Senior District Judge W. Earl Britt reduced the punitive portion to $2.5 million because of the state cap.</p><p>Raphael argued that nothing at Kinlaw’s farm constituted “willful and wanton conduct” and therefore punitive damages were unwarranted.</p><p>“There were no complaints to Murphy-Brown before the suits were filed,” he said. “There was no violation of North Carolina law.”</p><div id="zone-el-103" class="zone-el">&nbsp;</div><p>But Judge J. Harvie Wilkinson III, who was nominated to the Fourth Circuit by President Ronald Reagan and has served since 1984, suggested that Kinlaw’s neighbors were being made to suffer in part because of their modest means.</p><p>“If this were my property, I would be outraged at some of these conditions,” said Wilkinson, the court’s former chief judge. “And less fortunate fellow citizens, they have property rights too… They have a right to good health, and they have a right to enjoyment of their property.”</p><p>If the plaintiffs lived in “McMansions” or had political influence, Wilkinson asked, “wouldn’t these conditions have been cleaned up sooner rather than later?”</p><p>Wilkinson also alluded to the history of water contamination near large North Carolina hog operations, and to studies that have associated hog-farm emissions with health conditions like asthma. “Nobody wants another Flint, Michigan,” he said. “And this can’t be good for children’s respiratory systems.”</p><p>The judges reserved some criticism for the other side too. During the 2018 trial, plaintiffs’ attorney Michael Kaeske emphasized that Smithfield is a multibillion-dollar company and told jurors how much money top executives earned. “They know there is a problem,” Kaeske said in his closing statement. “They know there is a fix. They willfully choose not to do anything about it. Not even figure out how much it would cost, but yet they pay $245 million to four people over four years.”</p><div id="zone-el-104" class="zone-el">&nbsp;</div><p>At the Fourth Circuit, the plaintiffs’ appellate attorney, Tillman Breckenridge, said the company’s resources are relevant to its ability to solve the odor problem.</p><p>Wilkinson, though, suggested that bringing up executive compensation went beyond the pale. “Since when do corporate executives—how would they be expected to chip in 10, 15 percent of their salaries for abatement?” the judge asked. “Isn’t that just throwing a dead rat on the table?”</p><p>Likewise, Judge G. Steven Agee wondered why Kaeske told jurors that a Chinese company, WH Group, owns Smithfield. “I don’t see how any of that can be relevant,” said Agee, who was nominated by President George W. Bush.</p><p>The third judge, Stephanie Thacker, was largely silent. She was appointed by President Barack Obama.</p><p>The Fourth Circuit’s decision will help determine whether other cases against Murphy-Brown move forward. More than 500 North Carolinians filed a total of 26 lawsuits against the Smithfield subsidiary.&nbsp;<i>McKiver&nbsp;</i>and the other four trials were bellwether cases designed to test the strength of the plaintiffs’ claims.<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>Attorneys on both sides say it could take weeks, or even months, before the court makes a ruling.</p>',

Companies are also at risk of regulatory action if their products target kids or if they fail to take “adequate measures” to prevent access to children. They’ll still be able to sell tobacco and menthol-flavored pods for the adults who use the products to quit smoking.</p><div class="BoxInline-container  ">&nbsp;</div><p>“The United States has never seen an epidemic of substance use arise as quickly as our current epidemic of youth use of e-cigarettes,” Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar said in a statement Thursday.</p><p>“HHS is taking a comprehensive, aggressive approach to enforcing the law passed by Congress, under which no e-cigarettes are currently on the market legally,” he said.</p><p>The FDA is specifically banning cartridge-based nicotine pods like Juul, allowing vape shops to continue selling tank-based flavored nicotine liquids, which require users to manually fill their pods.</p><p>The agency’s decision comes amid a rise in teen e-cigarette use and a deadly lung illness linked to vaping that has taken the lives of 55 people across 27 states. The Trump administration&nbsp;originally announced plans&nbsp;to ban flavored e-cigarettes in September, but has delayed issuing its final rule under intense lobbying from the tobacco and vaping industry.</p><p>Azar told reporters on a call Thursday that the FDA’s decision to permit the continued sale of tobacco and menthol flavors was due to them being “less appealing” to kids. More than half of teenagers who vape use Juul e-cigarettes, and its mint pods were the No. 1 flavor favored by high school kids, according to&nbsp;two studies published in November&nbsp;in the Journal of the American Medical Association.</p><div id="MidResponsive-8" class="" data-module="mps-slot">&nbsp;</div><p>Juul, which is partially owned by tobacco giant&nbsp;voluntarily halted sales&nbsp;of its popular mint flavors shortly after the study was released.</p><p>Public health experts have long supported the administration’s goal of banning flavors that most appeal to children, but some fear that kids could end up switching to menthol once the fruity flavors are gone.</p><p>“Only the elimination of all flavored e-cigarettes can end the worsening youth e-cigarette epidemic and stop e-cigarette companies from luring and addicting kids with flavored products,” said Matthew Myers, president of the Campaign for Tobacco-Free Kids, said.</p><p>The ban has little to do with the vaping-related lung illness, administration officials said Thursday. Azar said the Trump administration sees the lung illness from vaping as a “separate issue” because most people who are sick are thought by public health officials to have smoked THC-based vaping products.</p><p>According to the CDC, most lung illness patients have reported vaping THC, the active ingredient in marijuana.</p><p>“No child should be using nicotine products,” officials repeatedly said on the call Thursday.</p><p>The ban will have a limited impact on industry leader Juul, which, under intense scrutiny, has already halted the sale of its flavors in the U.S.,&nbsp;excluding menthol, Virginia tobacco and classic tobacco. It will likely be a blow to Juul rival, NJOY, which looked to benefit from Juul’s flavor retreat with the sale its own blueberry flavors in stores.</p><p>The FDA’s new rules represent the U.S. government’s latest step to combat teen vaping.</p><p>Trump signed a law in December that prohibited the sale of cigarettes, e-cigarettes, cigars and other tobacco products to people under the age of 21</p>',

But backed with additional data about vitamin E acetate found in lung samples from people who were injured after vaping, she attributes the bulk of the outbreak to that additive.</p><p>The CDC is still trying to understand the mechanism by which this substance injures lung tissue. It may interfere with a natural fluid in the lung called surfactant, which helps make lung tissue stretchy. Or a byproduct may be a toxic chemical.</p><p>Emergency-room doctors in Wisconsin first noticed an outbreak of these lung injuries in June. They alerted state and federal health officials, who quickly&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/10/22/772368792/cdc-studying-tissue-to-try-and-track-down-root-cause-of-vaping-related-lung-dama">started investigating&nbsp;</a>the extent of the outbreak as they looked for what could be causing it.</p><p>Investigators homed in on vaping products containing marijuana extracts, specifically those that were purchased online or on the street, rather than through dispensaries. Further research focused on vitamin E acetate, which is used in some of these preparations to dilute the much more expensive THC oil.</p><h3><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/12/11/776356212/he-started-vaping-thc-to-cope-with-chronic-pain-then-he-got-sick" data-metrics="{&quot;category&quot;:&quot;Story to Story&quot;,&quot;action&quot;:&quot;Click Internal Link&quot;,&quot;label&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.npr.org\/sections\/health-shots\/2019\/12\/11\/776356212\/he-started-vaping-thc-to-cope-with-chronic-pain-then-he-got-sick&quot;}">He Started Vaping THC To Cope With Chronic Pain.

Then she settled in to testify against the world’s largest pork producer.</p><p>McKoy had traveled 90 miles from Bladen County, part of the flat and farm-heavy coastal plain that covers most of eastern North Carolina. Her family lives on a sandy cul-de-sac that recedes into a driveway flanked by “No Trespassing” signs. Her mother grew up on that land, working in the fields with her sharecropper father and playing in the woods nearby.</p><p>In the mid-1990s, a farmer named Billy Kinlaw bought the property at the end of the road. He built a dozen swine houses and three waste lagoons, large open pits that hold a slurry of feces and urine turned pink by bacterial action. Kinlaw began raising pigs, with a permit to house more than 14,000 at a time, most recently under contract to Murphy-Brown, the hog production subsidiary of Virginia-based Smithfield Foods.</p><p>During the late 20th century, as the tobacco economy declined, farms like Kinlaw’s transformed North Carolina into the country’s No. 2 hog production state, after Iowa. The state’s 2,300 swine operations are responsible for most of the 10 billion gallons of wet livestock waste generated in North Carolina, according to a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ewg.org/research/exposing-fields-filth">2016 analysis</a>&nbsp;by the Environmental Working Group and Waterkeeper Alliance, an international clean water group. There are roughly 3,300 waste lagoons, which occasionally overflow or breach their walls, particularly during hurricanes.</p><p>Many of the farms are near the homes of African American families like the McKoys. The journal&nbsp;<em>Environmental Health Perspectives</em>, which is funded by the federal government,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3672924/">described</a>&nbsp;the smell in these rural communities as “reminiscent of rotten eggs and ammonia.”<a href="https://fernnews-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/06._HogLawsuits_EQ_29-1.jpg"></a>Hog houses outside of Wallace, North Carolina. Neighbors of hog farming operations have pursued court battles against the smell of hog waste.</p><p>McKoy’s bedroom was close enough to the farm, she testified, that she could hear the animals squeal. “Like screeching—a screeching noise,” she said. She added that she could smell their waste, too, and tried to mask it with an air freshener and scented candles. Hog farm neighbors often complain that the odor, while intermittent, is so overpowering that they cannot tend their gardens, hang their laundry, or invite relatives over for cookouts. Industrial farms, they say, also bring flies, buzzards, and intense truck traffic day and night.</p><p>In 2014 more than 500 North Carolinians, most of them African American, blitzed Murphy-Brown with more than two dozen federal lawsuits. The plaintiffs included McKoy, her mother, and her elder brother. They argued that Smithfield, which dominates the state’s swine industry and owns the animals raised under the company’s contracts, has the resources to phase out the prevailing waste management system, which involves storing the pigs’ feces and urine in lagoons and then spraying it onto fields as fertilizer. They said the company can dispose of waste in less noxious ways but refuses to do so.</p>',

There are roughly 3,300 waste lagoons, which occasionally overflow or breach their walls, particularly during hurricanes.</p><p>Many of the farms are near the homes of African American families like the McKoys. The journal&nbsp;<em>Environmental Health Perspectives</em>, which is funded by the federal government,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3672924/">described</a>&nbsp;the smell in these rural communities as “reminiscent of rotten eggs and ammonia.”</p><aside class="left indent indents related-oneup"><h4>RELATED ARTICLE</h4><div class="oneup-blocks"><div class="oneup-block-img"><a class="imgHover" href="https://www.thenation.com/article/madrid-climate-summit-cop25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img src="https://www.thenation.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/climate-conference-un-2019-GT-img.jpg?scale=228&amp;compress=80" alt="The Nation"></a></div><h5>THIS IS WHY THE WORLD IS FACING CLIMATE CATASTROPHE</h5><p class="author">Ben Ehrenreich</p></div></aside><p>McKoy’s bedroom was close enough to the farm, she testified, that she could hear the animals squeal. “Like screeching—a screeching noise,” she said. She added that she could smell their waste, too, and tried to mask it with an air freshener and scented candles. Hog farm neighbors often complain that the odor, while intermittent, is so overpowering that they cannot tend their gardens, hang their laundry, or invite relatives over for cookouts.

The plaintiffs included McKoy, her mother, and her elder brother. They argued that Smithfield, which dominates the state’s swine industry and owns the animals raised under the company’s contracts, has the resources to phase out the prevailing waste management system, which involves storing the pigs’ feces and urine in lagoons and then spraying it onto fields as fertilizer.

The animals live in rows of buildings nearby, eating and excreting. Their manure flows into a big pond, called a lagoon, right in front of us. This is the standard form of treatment for hog waste in this part of the country. In the lagoon, bacteria go to work on the manure, breaking it down.</p><p>"The bacterial action releases a biogas that&apos;s 60% to 65% methane," Westerbeek says.</p><p>On most farms, that gas just goes floating off into the air — and contributes to the overheating of the planet. Methane is a greenhouse gas with a warming impact at least 25 times greater, per pound, than carbon dioxide.</p><aside id="ad-backstage-wrap"><section class="callout callout--newsletter callout--news " data-reactroot=""><div class="callout__inner"><div class="callout__main"><div>&nbsp;</div><footer class="callout__footer"><p>By subscribing, you agree to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179876898/terms-of-use">NPR&apos;s terms of use</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://www.npr.org/about-npr/179878450/privacy-policy">privacy policy</a>.</p><div>This site is protected by reCAPTCHA and the Google&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href="https://policies.google.com/terms">Terms of Service</a>&nbsp;apply.</div></footer></div></div></section></aside><p>At this lagoon, though, the gas is trapped by a blanket of rugged black plastic that covers the manure pond. The gas lifts the plastic layer and makes it bulge like the floor of a child&apos;s bouncy castle.</p><p>The gas then gets pumped out to processing stations that remove water vapor and carbon dioxide. What&apos;s left is almost pure methane, also called natural gas, ready to burn in any gas-fired home furnace or electric power plant.</p><p>This basic idea — turning manure into energy — is not new. Many dairy farms are&nbsp;<a href="https://www.dairycares.com/dairy-digesters">doing</a>&nbsp;similar things, often using biogas on-site to power a generator.</p><p>But Smithfield and the electric and gas utility Dominion Energy have formed a&nbsp;<a href="https://www.alignrng.com/?carousel=3">partnership</a>&nbsp;with much bigger plans.

They&apos;ll connect farms with miles of underground pipes, collecting methane and feeding it into existing natural gas pipelines. If no pipelines are close by, the gas may have to be trucked to its destination.</p><p>"We&apos;ve got audacious goals," says Ryan Childress, director of gas business development for Dominion Energy. "We&apos;ve got half a billion dollars behind it.

Since capturing it actually prevents greenhouse emissions, it&apos;s considered a zero-carbon fuel under the rules of emissions accounting. If you burn this "renewable natural gas," the carbon dioxide that&apos;s inevitably released isn&apos;t counted as part of your carbon footprint. In fact, because the reduction in methane emissions from manure lagoons far outweighs the carbon dioxide emissions from burning it, it&apos;s sometimes considered a "negative-carbon" fuel that cancels out other greenhouse emissions.</p><p>That&apos;s the key to this business: People or companies who are trying to reduce their carbon emissions will pay extra for it — perhaps twice as much as regular natural gas.</p><p>"What changed, fundamentally, is the market for renewable natural gas, [and] the market for carbon, have allowed us to develop a business model, an economic model, that works for everybody involved," Westerbeek says.</p><p>According to Smithfield and Dominion Energy, the project will capture about 105,000 metric tons of methane each year. That will reduce the country&apos;s greenhouse emissions as much as taking half a million cars off the road.</p><p>For people who worry about climate change, it&apos;s a clear win. Farmers also stand to earn more money, since they&apos;ll get a share of the methane sales.</p><p><strong>Pushback from community</strong></p><p>Others, however, may not see much benefit. The manure lagoons at the center of this project are the focus of heated&nbsp;<a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/a-hog-waste-agreement-lacked-teeth-and-some-north-carolinians-say-left-to-suffer">controversy</a>&nbsp;in North Carolina for reasons unrelated to their greenhouse emissions. Some nearby residents would rather see them removed entirely.</p><p>"I think they can do better," says Devon Hall, who founded the Rural Empowerment Association for Community Help (<a href="https://www.ncruralempowerment.org/">REACH</a>), which is based in Warsaw, N.C.</p><p>"There&apos;s at least eight to 10 swine operations within a 2-mile radius of where I live and work," Hall says. People who live near those farms have complained about the smell, especially when farmers spray waste on fields. Twice in recent years, manure lagoons have flooded during hurricanes.</p><p>Over the past two years, North Carolina residents have won a series of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.calt.iastate.edu/article/update-north-carolina-nuisance-lawsuits">lawsuits</a>&nbsp;that accused a Smithfield subsidiary of causing a public nuisance. Smithfield is&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ncfarmfamilies.com/farmkeepersblog/all-eyes-on-richmond-an-update-on-murphy-browns-appeal-of-nuisance-lawsuits">appealing</a>&nbsp;those verdicts.</p><p>"This is a classic case of greenwashing," says Blakely Hildebrand, an attorney with the Southern Environmental Law Center, which has&nbsp;<a href="https://www.southernenvironment.org/news-and-press/news-feed/tell-the-state-to-clean-up-industrial-hog-waste-in-north-carolina">called</a>&nbsp;for stricter environmental regulation of the pork industry. Greenwashing refers to attempts by companies to paint themselves as friends of the environment for public relations purposes.</p><p>"Smithfield is saying that they&apos;re going to come in and cap these lagoons and solve this major climate crisis. But they&apos;re ignoring the nuisance conditions that led to these to these civil lawsuits in the first place," Hildebrand says.</p><p>Hall has not been involved in those lawsuits. But he, too, says he would "like to see some changes" at the swine operations. "There&apos;s a lot of things, a lot of issues that we would love to discuss," he says.</p><p>Community activists say that capturing methane, by itself, is not the answer. They want farmers to adopt new technologies for handling hog waste that get rid of lagoons altogether.</p><p>Some&nbsp;<a href="https://projects.ncsu.edu/cals/waste_mgt/smithfield_projects/smithfieldsite.htm">alternatives</a>&nbsp;do exist. According to Smithfield, though, they cost too much to adopt on a large scale.</p>',

Despite the low levels reported and in full cooperation and collaboration with the FDA, JJCI is initiating this voluntary recall of Lot #22318RB of Johnson’s Baby Powder, from which the tested sample was taken.</p><p>In parallel, JJCI has immediately initiated a rigorous, thorough investigation into this matter, and is working with the FDA to determine the integrity of the tested sample, and the validity of the test results. At this early stage of the investigation, JJCI:</p><ul><li>Cannot confirm if cross-contamination of the sample caused a false positive.</li><li>Cannot confirm whether the sample was taken from a bottle with an intact seal or whether the sample was prepared in a controlled environment.</li><li>Cannot confirm whether the tested product is authentic or counterfeit.</li></ul><p>JJCI has a rigorous testing standard in place to ensure its cosmetic talc is safe and years of testing, including the FDA’s own testing on prior occasions--and as recently as last month--found no asbestos. Thousands of tests over the past 40 years repeatedly confirm that our consumer talc products do not contain asbestos. Our talc comes from ore sources confirmed to meet our stringent specifications that exceed industry standards. Not only do we and our suppliers routinely test to ensure our talc does not contain asbestos, our talc has also been tested and confirmed to be asbestos-free by a range of independent laboratories, universities and global health authorities.</p><p>For 133 years, the Johnson &amp; Johnson Family of Companies have been committed to putting the needs and well-being of the people we serve first, and we will continue to do so.If you or someone you provide care for owns a bottle of Johnson’s Baby Powder Lot #22318RB, you are advised to discontinue use of the product.

It’s not known what triggered the relapses. In some cases, patients had resumed vaping. It’s also possible that initial<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/as-vaping-related-lung-illnesses-spike-investigators-eye-contaminants/2019/08/29/cfe26032-ca78-11e9-be05-f76ac4ec618c_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;lung damage&nbsp;</a>made patients more vulnerable to other illness. Another possibility, she said, is that treatment with steroids, which many clinicians have been using to care for such injuries, may “set you up for increased infection risk.”</p><div class="absolute z-0">The CDC did not reveal exactly how many relapse cases have been logged, but Schuchat said the agency is aware of fewer than five such cases among the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/basic_information/e-cigarettes/severe-lung-disease.html#latest-outbreak-information" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">1,299 that have been reported</a>. At least 28 people have died in the vaping-related outbreak.</div></div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">A 17-year-old male from the Bronx who died of vaping-related injuries Oct. 4 had been hospitalized twice. He was first hospitalized in early September and readmitted later that month. New York officials&nbsp;<a href="https://www.governor.ny.gov/news/video-audio-rush-transcript-governor-cuomo-comments-first-vaping-related-death-new-york-state" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported his death&nbsp;</a>Tuesday. Health officials there are investigating the products he vaped.</p><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In Utah, there have been two cases where patients were readmitted after they resumed vaping, according to Dixie Harris, a pulmonologist and critical care physician at Intermountain Healthcare in Salt Lake City, which has handled more than 60 cases. Both patients “ended up with surgery and significant lung complications,” she said. To protect their privacy, she declined to provide additional details.</p><div class="absolute z-0">Doctors and officials are particularly concerned about the young people who have fallen ill. Eighty percent are under 35 years old, and 15 percent are under 18. Of 80 patients under 18 for whom the CDC has complete clinical information, 56 required&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/one-mans-near-death-experience-with-vaping-related-lung-failure/2019/08/24/ca8ce42c-c5b4-11e9-9986-1fb3e4397be4_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_12" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">intensive care&nbsp;</a>and almost 1 in 3 needed mechanical ventilation to breathe, Schuchat said.</div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In many cases, doctors say, teenagers have told them they vaped as a way to deal with stress and anxiety. Doctors said those underlying problems need to be addressed.</p><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">“I think we miss the boat if we treat the lung disease and then send them home to high risk for recurrence,” said Anne Griffiths, a pediatric pulmonologist at Children’s Minnesota who has handled about half of the two dozen cases at the pediatric hospital and reviews all the state’s vaping-related cases. Some of the teens have told doctors they rely on vaping THC to help them sleep, she said.</p><div class="absolute z-0">“My response to them is, if you are sedated, that’s not the same as healthy sleep,” she said. The bottom line, she said: “Discharging children home after this lung injury without counseling or therapy or addiction management, I think, is a big mistake.”</div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">In Dallas, pediatric pulmonologist Devika Rao at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center said of the hospital’s approximately one dozen cases, “a minority” have involved relapse. Some of patients are struggling with difficult social situations and family dynamics, and also have anxiety and depression, Rao said. Doctors are working with addiction psychiatrists to address the patients’ mental needs, she said.</p><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">“These children who are coming in with vaping illnesses, they’re addicted, and many are addicted to marijuana,” she said. “A lot of them are afraid to tell us they’ve been vaping. … It’s really important not to shame teenagers about these injuries because it diminishes the rapport and the potential that you can help them get better.”</p><div class="absolute z-0">To help clinicians better diagnose and treat these cases, the CDC released more&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6841e3.htm?s_cid=mm6841e3_w%20[cdc.gov]" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">specific guidelines&nbsp;</a>Friday. The guidelines emphasize a close follow-up of patients because some with only mild symptoms experienced a rapid worsening within 48 hours. The CDC is also recommending that health-care providers strongly advise patients to stop using e-cigarettes or other vaping products. For those with addiction to nicotine or THC products, patients should consider cognitive behavioral therapy and consultation with addiction medicine services, the guidelines state.</div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">With the start of flu season, the CDC is also stressing the importance of health-care providers asking patients about their use of e-cigarette or other vaping products “in a nonjudgmental way.” Vaping-related injuries and respiratory viral illnesses, such as<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2018/10/25/drop-adult-flu-vaccinations-may-be-factor-last-seasons-record-breaking-deaths-illnesses/?tid=lk_inline_manual_23" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;influenza,</a>&nbsp;have similar symptoms: cough, shortness of breath and difficulty breathing. In the vaping-related cases, nearly 80 percent also have gastrointestinal symptoms including abdominal pain, nausea and diarrhea, officials said.</p><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Officials still don’t know the cause of the injuries. Schuchat said there may be more than one cause. The most recent data confirms earlier information that most patients used products containing&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/potential-culprits-in-mystery-lung-illnesses-black-market-vaping-products/2019/09/24/cb5b708e-d98d-11e9-ac63-3016711543fe_story.html?tid=lk_inline_manual_24" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">THC,&nbsp;</a>the psychoactive ingredient in marijuana.</p><div class="absolute z-0">The CDC on Friday backed away from its earlier, broader recommendation against using all vaping products and narrowed its recommendation instead to warn individuals against using e-cigarette or vaping products that contain THC, especially those bought off the street.</div><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">But a small proportion of patients have reported exclusively using nicotine-containing products, and many people with these lung injuries have reported combined use of THC- and nicotine-containing products. The CDC said agency officials cannot exclude the possibility that nicotine-containing products play a role in this outbreak.</p><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">The Food and Drug Administration has collected more than 725 samples from roughly half the states with reported cases. But the agency’s forensics lab in Cincinnati has only been able to initiate testing for about 300 of them because many samples contain little or no liquid, said Mitch Zeller, director of FDA’s Center for Tobacco Products. Of 225 products tested that contain THC, nearly half contained&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/09/05/contaminant-found-vaping-products-linked-deadly-lung-illnesses-state-federal-labs-show/?tid=lk_inline_manual_29" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">vitamin E acetate,&nbsp;</a>a cutting agent used to stretch the amount of THC in vape cartridges, he said. Experts in the legal marijuana industry have said vitamin E acetate has been used on the marijuana black market because it is colorless and odorless, has similar viscosity to THC oil and is much cheaper.</p><p class="font--body font-copy color-gray-darkest ma-0 pad-bottom-md undefined">Vitamin E acetate, which is sold legally, is commonly used as a nutritional supplement and in skin-care products. It’s not harmful when ingested or applied to the skin. But health officials have warned it could be&nbsp;<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/health/2019/09/09/new-york-subpoena-firms-selling-substances-linked-illicit-vaping-products/?tid=lk_inline_manual_25&amp;tid=lk_inline_manual_32">hazardous&nbsp;</a>when inhaled, potentially causing the sorts of symptoms many patients have reported: cough, shortness of breath and chest pain.</p>',

    body: '<p>A North Carolina hospital offered some of the first clues into what’s been an ongoing medical mystery, the vaping-related lung injuries that have killed 18 people in the country to date and sent more than a thousand to hospitals with serious injuries.</p><p>Officials with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced the new death count Thursday afternoon and continued to strongly urge people to avoid using any vaping or e-cigarette devices given the current dangers and unknown nature of the current health crisis.</p><p>“I wish we had more answers,” said Anne Schuchat, CDC’s principal deputy director. “This is a critical issue.”</p><p>Doctors at the WakeMed Raleigh campus saw three relatively young adults come in within a week of each other this summer, all struggling to breathe and with no other obvious signs of what could be causing their distress, said Kevin Davidson, one of the critical care pulmonologists at WakeMed, in an interview with N.C. Health News.</p><p>All three patients told doctors they recently vaped some form of Tetrahydrocannabinol</p><p>(THC), the active compound in marijuana that leads to the characteristic high. Davidson and his colleagues quickly realized there may be a danger that stretched far beyond the treatment rooms of the Raleigh hospital.</p><p data-autoattached="true">“We immediately knew there was something wrong and we picked up the phone” to call state health officials and the CDC, Davidson said. He recalled relaying, “’I’ve never made a report like this, but I think there’s something wrong with these young vapers.’”</p><p>Davidson and his colleagues ended up authoring a brief case report about five vaping-related cases, which was published in mid-September in the CDC’s&nbsp;<a href="https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/68/wr/mm6836e1.htm?s_cid=mm6836e1_w" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report</a>&nbsp;and mentioned the link to THC as well as diagnoses of lipoid pneumonia, a rare condition that occurs when fat particles enter the lungs. It was an early, but important, puzzle piece to help doctors around the country in their quest to figure out what exactly has been causing the lung injuries to e-cigarette users that are in the news.</p><p>Davidson’s scientifically deduced hunch about a link to THC products appears to have panned out. CDC experts last week&nbsp;<a href="https://khn.org/morning-breakout/cdc-finds-majority-of-patients-with-mysterious-lung-disease-say-they-were-vaping-marijuana-compound/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">issued particular caution against</a>&nbsp;vaping THC-containing substances after the agency – building on reports from around the country – found that among 578 lung injury patients, about 78 percent reported vaping THC in the three months prior to presenting with the injuries, with 36 percent indicating they’d only vaped THC, and no nicotine.</p><p>Most of the people affected bought their THC vaping cartridges from the streets or from dealers, according to CDC officials. Cartridges of vaping substances are being tested by the FDA to pinpoint what precisely is harming people. The FDA is also looking at links between THC substances and the presence of vitamin E, according to FDA officials.</p><p>On Thursday, Schuchat also addressed discrepancies between the report by the WakeMed clinicians and a letter&nbsp;<a href="https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMc1913069" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published this week in the New England Journal of Medicine</a>&nbsp;by Mayo Clinic doctors that examined 17 different patients with vaping-related lung injuries and found no signs of lipoid pneumonia.</p><p>She emphasized that both hypotheses could end up being true, given that so much is unknown about what is in vaping and e-cigarette cartridges and what is behind the recent lung injuries.</p><p>“It’s &nbsp;early days in understanding the full clinical spectrum and the pathology of lung injuries following e-cigarette use or vaping,” Schuchat said. The September WakeMed report “came from a group of clinicians in North Carolina and I think it was very helpful in raising questions and alarms.</p><p>“There may be a lot of different nasty things in e-cigarettes or vaping products and they may cause different harms in the lungs,” she said.</p><h4><b>Emerging research</b></h4><p>Public health officials have been issuing warnings for years about the potential, though largely unknown, dangers of e-cigarettes and vaping. They’ve pointed, in particular, to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.northcarolinahealthnews.org/2018/02/15/health-officials-alarmed-at-uptick-in-teen-vaping/" target="_self">the meteoric rise of JUUL</a>&nbsp;use among teenagers and young adults during a time when cigarette and other tobacco use were at record lows. JUUL, the e-cigarette start-up company that captured a majority of the&nbsp; e-cigarette market, is facing tightening regulations under the FDA.

Attorney General Josh Stein</a>, accusing the company of illegally targeting youth through marketing with the flavored nicotine products.</p><p>E-cigarettes have been seen by some as a way of delivering nicotine to those already addicted in a way that’s less harmful than traditional cigarettes, with their well-known links to cancer and declines in life expectancy.</p><p>But in a paper released<a href="https://www.bmj.com/content/366/bmj.l5275.full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">&nbsp;this week in</a>&nbsp;the BMJ (British Medical Journal), scientists, including one from Duke University and another from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, found that the long-term effects of vaping nicotine salts and other substances found in various vaping liquids may not be fully understood yet but preliminary data is pointing to harmful effects. The authors determined that e-cigarette aerosols can harm lungs on the cellular level as well as how the organ functions in the overall immune system, and vaping “will likely prove to have at least some pulmonary toxicity with chronic and possibly even short term use.”</p><p>Another paper published last month by UNC researchers in the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.atsjournals.org/doi/pdf/10.1164/rccm.201903-0615OC" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;found the lungs of vapers had elevated levels of protease enzymes, which has led to emphysema in smokers.</p><p>“Our findings in this study indicate that vaping may not be safer than cigarette smoking,” said Robert Tarran, a professor of cell biology and physiology at the UNC School of Medicine,&nbsp;<a href="https://news.unchealthcare.org/news/2019/august/e-cigs-can-trigger-same-lung-changes-seen-in-smokers-emphysema" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in a release&nbsp;</a>about the study.</p><p>But the recent reports of lung injuries are not just about the unknown dangers of long-term use of inhaling nicotine through vaping devices or pushing a new generation toward nicotine addictions.</p><p>First noticed this summer, hospitals around the country have been treating people for severe lung injuries, conditions that have required ventilators and stays in intensive care units. This has left doctors to speculate a particular substance in vaping compounds is leading to the sudden onset of respiratory issues.</p><p data-autoattached="true">Eighteen have died, with the recent death of a Virginia resident at Greensboro’s Cone Health system included in that count. Schuchat said there are additional deaths being reviewed, and she expected the death toll to rise.</p><p>The CDC, state-level health officials and others around the country are scrambling to analyze commonalities among patients while urging people to stop vaping or using e-cigarettes until they can pinpoint an exact reason for the injuries.</p><p>“This is still very much something that is under investigation,” said Zack Moore, a pediatrician who serves as the state epidemiologist with the N.C. Department of Health and Human Services. “Avoid vaping and e-cigarettes while this investigation is still undergoing.”</p><h4><b>NC doctors spotted early cases&nbsp;</b></h4><p>Davidson, the WakeMed pulmonologist at the Raleigh hospital, said he and his colleagues were taken aback by the relatively young ages of the patients exhibiting what’s since been linked to vaping.</p><p>It was a perplexing combination – people in their 20s who are relativity healthy don’t often need a pulmonologist’s help. It’s a rare situation where Davidson is called to the bedside of a young person who has been in otherwise good health, he said.</p><p>The symptoms also initially seemed to resemble infection-related pneumonia, a serious respiratory condition that can be a killer for those with weakened immune systems.</p><p>But, again, “people in this age group don’t get pneumonia,” Davidson recalled thinking when presented with his first ailing patient.</p><p data-autoattached="true">Bronchoscopies – procedures where a thin tube is passed through the nose or mouth and led into the lungs for biopsies or ultrasounds – were performed and though there were clusters of white blood cells, typically a sign of an infection, ineffective rounds of antibiotics showed that a more typical infection wasn’t the culprit.</p><p>The patients were diagnosed with lipoid pneumonia, which is when fat enters the lungs and causes negative reactions.</p><h4><b>CDC closely tracking reports</b></h4><p>The CDC is getting closer to cracking the medical mystery, with data from hospitals around the country like WakeMed and the Children’s Hospital of Wisconsin, the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.jsonline.com/story/news/local/milwaukee/2019/09/16/vaping-illness-childrens-hospital-wisconsin-doctors-discover-link-lung-disease/2338343001/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">first in the country to</a>&nbsp;raise alarms about the mystery lung ailments.</p><p>North Carolina has seen 40 cases, ranging in ages from 16 to 72, with patients experiencing severe cough and shortness of breath in addition to fever, fatigue, chest pain, nausea, vomiting or diarrhea, according to&nbsp;<a href="https://www.tobaccopreventionandcontrol.ncdhhs.gov/ecigs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ongoing updates provided</a>&nbsp;by the N.C.

In sum, the plaintiffs, ranging in age from their teens to 85, were awarded a total of $50.7 million.</span></p><p><span>“We are pleased with the verdict,” said Mona Lisa Wallace of Wallace and Graham law firm in Salisbury, in a prepared statement. The firm represented the plaintiffs, and Michael Kaeske argued the case. &nbsp;“These cases are about North Carolina family property rights and a clean environment.&nbsp; I am grateful for the hard work of our co-counsel, Mike Kaeske, and the others who worked on this trial.&nbsp; We are now preparing for the next which is scheduled for the end of May.”</span></p><p><span>At least a half-dozen more trials related to nuisances from industrialized hog farms are scheduled through the fall.</span></p><p><span>Smithfield Foods,&nbsp;a $15 billion global food company,&nbsp;issued a statement in response to the verdict, which the company said it will appeal to the Fourth Circuit Court. Here it is in full:</span></p><p><span>“We are extremely disappointed by the verdict. We will appeal to the Fourth Circuit, and we are confident we will prevail. We believe the outcome would have been different if the court had allowed the jury to (1) visit the plaintiffs’ properties and the Kinlaw farm and (2) hear additional vital evidence, especially the results of our expert’s odor-monitoring tests.</span></p><p><span>These lawsuits are an outrageous attack on animal agriculture, rural North Carolina and thousands of independent family farmers who own and operate contract farms. These farmers are apparently not safe from attack even if they fully comply with all federal, state and local laws and regulations. The lawsuits are a serious threat to a major industry, to North Carolina’s entire economy and to the jobs and livelihoods of tens of thousands of North Carolinians.</span></p><p><span>From the beginning, the lawsuits have been nothing more than a money grab by a big litigation machine. Plaintiffs’ original lawyers promised potential plaintiffs a big payday. Those lawyers were condemned by a North Carolina state court for unethical practices. Plaintiffs’ counsel at trial relied heavily on anti-agriculture, anti-corporate rhetoric rather than the real facts in the case. These practices are abuses of our legal system, and we will continue to fight them.”</span></p><p><span>The original jury pool of 40 or so people was roughly 50 percent Black. But after Smithfield attorneys finished their challenges to the jurors, the final 10-person panel was predominantly white. (A 12th juror, also white, became ill early in the trial and could not continue serving; another juror was excused because they knew one of the witnesses..) All of the plaintiffs are Black. Most are related and live in modest homes adjacent to Kinlaw Farms, which raises 15,000 hogs owned by Murphy-Brown/Smithfield Foods.his is a different Don Butler than the one that worked for Murphy-Brown.)</span></p><p><span>Attorney Mark Anderson, who represented Murphy-Brown, cited state law that caps the amount of punitive damages. He said that punitives can’t be more than three times the compensatory damages — in this case, $225,000 per plaintiff — or $250,000, whichever is higher. If the jury awards more than that amount, the trial court is supposed to reduce the award to the maximum amount.</span></p><p><span>However, Michelle Nowlin, clinical professor of law and supervising attorney for the Environmental Law and Policy Clinic at Duke University, said the standards could be different because this trial was held in federal court, not state court. But if the ratio of compensatory to punitive damages is more than 1 to 10, then the award could be reviewed; the extra damages aren’t prohibited, but do receive additional scruinty. If that standard applies in this case, the punitive awards could be capped at $750,000 per plaintiff.</span></p><p><span>Update:&nbsp;Nowlin later added that the state statute does apply. Some other states have found caps to be unconstitutional, but North Carolina is not one of them. In other states, judges have the discretion to uphold a jury’s award, as long as the judge determines the award is not “excessive.” In North Carolina, though, the judge does not have this discretion.</span></p><p><span>The state statue also prohibits the attorneys and the court from informing the jury of the cap on punitive damages.</span></p><p><span>Nowlin was not involved in the case, but is an expert in agricultural law and policy, and led the Southern Environmental Law Center’s Hog Industry Project.</span></p><p><span>Nonetheless,, Nowlin wrote in an email. “to award any punitive damages, the jury was required to find that the company committed fraud, or acted with malice, or engaged in willful or wanton conduct.”</span></p><p><span>“This is a significant victory for the community members who live next to these factory feedlots,” she said in a written statement. “They have suffered indescribable insults, not just from the immediate impacts of the feedlots themselves, but also from decades of government failure to come to their aid. Litigation was their last chance for justice, and this verdict and award will help them move forward.”</span></p>',

The powerful stench from these pools has been making life miserable for nearby residents.</span></p><p><span>Last week, a federal court in Raleigh kicked off the first trail in a series of lawsuits against Murphy-Brown LLC, the hog-production&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.vault.com/company-profiles/agriculture-forestry/murphy-brown-llc/company-overview"><span>subsidiary</span></a><span>&nbsp;of the Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, which oversees the production of many of these industrial-scale pig farms in North Carolina. The suits could lead to long overdue changes in how these factory farms operate in the state.</span></p><p><span>The lawsuits, 26 in all, by over 500 people living near industrial pig farms in the eastern North Carolina, were filed in 2014. The plaintiffs allege the stench and pollutants from the open hog-waste pools have been detrimental to their health and wellbeing. The waste from these pools is usually sprayed onto nearby fields as fertilizer. The plaintiffs complain that that malodorous mist from the spray wafts over to their properties; that improperly dumped rotting-pig carcasses add to the general stink that makes it impossible to spend any quality time outside.</span></p><p><span>This first trial concerns 10 plaintiffs in Bladen County who live near Kinlaw Farm, which has three open-air cesspools. The farm owners, who raise some 15,000 hogs each year under contract with Murphy-Brown, are not defendants in the case. This suit, like the other 25 as well, is against Murphy-Brown since the company sets rules for how these farms should operate.</span></p><p><span>“I’ve never been to hell before, but it’s like living in hell,” says Rene Miller, a plaintiff in one of the lawsuits. “I have no control over my own land, my own house, because of the scent, the spray. I have rats coming in my house now.”</span></p><p><span>Miller explains that living so close to the hog farming waste lagoons has contributed to serious health problems for her and her neighbors. She cites asthma, sinus problems, high blood pressure, and cancer as common symptoms experienced by individuals living near the hog operations. The waste is sprayed just 200 feet away from her house.</span></p><p><span>“Its an odor worse than a decomposed body, that’s what I smell in my home and the whole road I live on,” she says.</span></p><p><span>Pigs raised on factory farms are confined in metal and concrete pens with hard slatted flooring.

An&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ewg.org/agmag/2016/07/manure-mist-hog-hell-permeates-duplin-county-nc"><span>analysis</span></a><span>&nbsp;conducted by WaterKeeper Alliance found that out of 2,246 hog CAFOs in North Carolina, only 12 have been required to obtain permits under the Clean Water Act.</span></p><p><span>“The industry is more heavily concentrated here than any other place on Earth. There are more hogs, more densely concentrated than anyplace else, says Kemp Burdette,&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.capefearriverwatch.org/about-us/mission"><span>Riverkeeper</span></a><span>&nbsp;for Cape Fear River, a blackwater river in east central North Carolina. (The Cape Fear River Basin has more factory farms in than any other place on Earth.) “Anytime you get that many animals together in a small area, you’re going to have problems,”</span></p><p><span>“I go out to take water samples and frequently find levels of bacteria dozens, hundreds, and sometimes even thousands of times higher than the safe limit set by the state,” Burdette says. “And these are in areas where the only possible source of these pollutants are these factory farms.”</span></p><p><span>Environmental racism is an issue at the forefront of these lawsuits, as these factory farms are predominantly located in communities of color. A 2014&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.ncpolicywatch.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/UNC-Report.pdf"><span>study</span></a><span>&nbsp;conducted by the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill found black people are 1.54 times more likely to live within three miles of an industrial hog operation in North Carolina, with Native Americans 2.14 times higher than non-Hispanic whites.</span></p><p><span>“People feel like prisoners in their own homes,” says Naemma Muhammad, co-director of North Carolina Environmental Justice Network. “People can’t open their doors and windows anytime they want to. They have to negotiate with the air to decide when is the best time to go outside. They can’t hang their clothes on their clotheslines anymore because the waste will get in their clothes and they’ll have to redo their laundry. And if they wear the clothes, they’ll smell like it all day. They either have to go to laundromats or purchase washers and dryers.”</span></p><p><span>Muhammad explains this places even more strain on residents in these low-income communities who already live on fixed budgets. “They can’t enjoy their property the way they meant to when they moved there and property values are being constantly depleted because of these dirty industries,” she says.</span></p><p><span>It’s not just residents that suffer from the waste produced by this industry, Muhammad notes. Large companies like Smithfield Foods use contract farmers to operate many of these facilities (as is the case with Kinlaw Farm), which pits these individuals, who are basically trying to earn a livelihood, against their neighbors. The companies own the animals, feed, infrastructure, and homes of these contract growers. “They tell [the farmers] it’s not economically feasible to implement clean technology, yet Smithfield Foods was&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/2013/05/29/smithfield-foods-china-acquisition/2368671/"><span>bought&nbsp;</span></a><span>in 2013 for $4.7 billion on top of the regular profits these operations churn out regularly.” (Smithfield was purchased by the Chinese corporation WH Group, the world’s largest pork producer.)</span></p><p><span>North Carolina is the second-largest pork producer in the country and given the state’s laws favor corporate-owned farms, it has been hard to bring Smithfield to book here. The company has been attempting to get these suits dismissed since they were filed four years ago, claiming that it was protected by North Carolina’s right-to-farm laws and hadn’t broken any state regulations.</span></p><p><span>Smithfield also has enormous lobbying power in the state. Just last year, in an attempt prevent further lawsuits like these, the North Carolina general assembly passed a law that limits&nbsp;damages in future lawsuits by property owners near hog farms. The law — which was drafted by politicians who have&nbsp;</span><a href="https://www.indyweek.com/news/archives/2017/05/11/the-nc-senate-overrides-coopers-hb-467-veto-hog-farm-protection-bill-is-law"><span>received big donations from the pork industry</span></a><span>&nbsp;— says that a court cannot award a property owner who claims that a nearby farm or forestry operation has caused nuisance, damages above the actual market value of the property.</span></p><p><span>Since the law doesn’t apply to lawsuits already in progress there’s still hope that the verdicts and damages awarded in these 26 cases could prompt better regulation of hog farms in North Carolina.</span></p><p><span>The hearing on the first suit is expected to last about six weeks after which the next suit in the series will be taken up.</span></p><p><span>Smithfield Foods did not immediately respond to a request for comment on this story.</span></p>',

    body: '<p><span>After lawyers gave their closing remarks in a groundbreaking trial over the stench of hog farms in Eastern North Carolina, U.S. District Court Judge Earl Britt left the courtroom with a parting thought:</span></p><p><span>"My only comment is that I am tired of looking at that dirty hog," he said, referring to a waste-coated, life-size hog model that has been sitting inside the courtroom for the past three weeks. Then, Britt dismissed the ten-person jury to begin deliberating the outcome of a trial that could have major implications for the future of commercial hog farming in North Carolina.</span></p><p><span>The case that closed yesterday afternoon was the first in a series of twenty-six federal lawsuits filed by neighbors of hog farms against Murphy-Brown LLC, a subsidiary of the Chinese-owned global food giant Smithfield Foods. The plaintiffs suing Murphy-Brown argue that the company&apos;s waste-management practices, which consist of storing excess hog waste in open-air cesspools behind hog pens and then liquefying and spraying the remains onto nearby fields, has made their lives miserable. Among other things, they say that the odors and mist from the spray drift onto their property; that the hogs attract swarms of flies, buzzards, and gnats; that boxes filled with rotting dead hogs produce an especially pungent stink; and that the stench has limited their ability to go outside.</span></p><p><span>The trial involved ten plaintiffs who live near Kinlaw Farm, a large-scale hog operation in Bladen County that contracts with Murphy-Brown to raise about 15,000 hogs. Those hogs produce a tremendous amount of waste: about 153,000 pounds a day, according to Mike Kaeske, an attorney representing the plaintiffs. Since the trial began, Kaeske told the jury, Kinlaw Farm has produced enough waste to fill up the entire courtroom.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>"It only takes common sense to know that 153,000 pounds of hog waste stinks," an exasperated Kaeske said in his closing statement. "And that it affects the neighbors. They told you."</span></p><p><span>Attorneys for Smithfield contest plaintiffs&apos; claims that Kinlaw&apos;s hog operation has negatively interfered with their lives, pointing out that the neighbors involved in the case never filed complaints against the farm for the stench before the litigation began in 2014.</span></p><p><span>But the plaintiffs say they&apos;ve dealt with nausea, burning and watery eyes, stress, anger, and worry due to the odor from the farms for years. Plaintiff Delois Lewis, according to court records, can no longer hang clothes outside to dry because they will absorb the hogs&apos; odors. Archie Wright says he can occasionally hear the screams of hogs through the wooded area that separates his home from the farm, and he can no longer open his windows to air out his home. His girlfriend, Teresa Lloyd, "spends much less time outside now than before the Facility was constructed due to the bugs and the odor."</span></p><p><span>Throughout the trial, Kaeske has argued that Smithfield—a multibillion-dollar company—has enough money to introduce alternative waste-management technologies on its farms that would reduce the stench, such as covering the lagoons and introducing "supersoil" technology, but has done nothing because it doesn&apos;t want to pay for it.</span></p><p><span>"The industry built these operations this way because it was the cheapest," Kaeske said. "And they won&apos;t change now because they don&apos;t want to spend the money."</span></p><p><span>Kaeske added that WH Group, the Chinese corporation that purchased Smithfield in 2013 for an estimated $4.7 billion, made $2 billion in profits last year. The cost of covering all the lagoons in the North Carolina, Kaeske told the court, would total about $500 million, around half of what Smithfield makes each year after taxes. Between 2010 and 2015, he said, four Smithfield executives earned a combined total of $245 million.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Kaeske&apos;s emphasis on the company&apos;s bottom line did not sit well with Smithfield attorney Mark Anderson, who said he was "frustrated, listening to all this talk about big corporations, big money"—rhetoric he called "anti-corporation and anti-agriculture." Throughout the trial, hog farming industry advocates have consistently painted the litigation as an assault on hard-working family farmers, although the lawsuits are not targeting the farmers that contract with Murphy-Brown. Anderson, in his opening remarks, said the lawsuits are motivated by "out-of-town people with an agenda."</span></p><p><span>Anderson disputed Kaeske&apos;s claim that Murphy-Brown&apos;s waste-management system substantially interfered with its neighbors&apos; ability to use and enjoy their properties. Before the lawsuits were filed, he argued, the plaintiffs had never filed complaints about Kinlaw Farm—"a gorgeous farm"— he said, before showing a series of picturesque photos from the property.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>He also argued that the properties directly around the farm have become more valuable in recent years, including a rental property near the farm that has gotten mainly five-star reviews. And other neighbors who live near the farm aren&apos;t bothered by the smell, he said. "When Mr. Kinlaw has a party they do it right on the farm."</span></p><p><span>Kaeske disputed almost everything Anderson said and told the jury that he had consistently had to "come behind Mr. Anderson and show you how what he said was wrong. This is how a company defends itself from neighbors."</span></p><p><span>He ended by appealing to jurors&apos; support for the plaintiffs, telling them that they had more power than the Governor of North Carolina and the Attorney General.</span></p><p><span>"If you believe that it&apos;s a substantial and unreasonable burden, help me fight for these people," he concluded.</span></p>',

The tariffs slapped on U.S. pork going to China, the lack of a re-negotiated North American Free Trade Agreement, and other policy decisions have put the pork industry on edge. But an issue much closer to home should have you just as concerned.</span></p><p><span>The pending nuisance lawsuit in North Carolina against Smithfield subsidiary Murphy-Brown LLC, could change the way the pork industry does business if the judge rules for the plaintiffs. In fact, there are a total of 26 federal lawsuits filed by more than 500 plaintiffs who live near hog farms in eastern North Carolina (read the full article here). The lawsuits are about odor and particles from uncovered lagoons.</span></p><p><span>Did odors exist before out-of-state lawyers came to town and rallied the neighbors into becoming part of a lawsuit? More than likely. It was probably the combination of lack of communication, encouragement from said lawyers, and an effort to take a stand against “big ag” that helped convince plaintiffs to take the step toward litigation. It also may have been the lack of a plan to address potential problems, or the lack of positive, proactive neighbor relations.</span></p><p><span>Could It Have Been Avoided?</span></p><p><span>It’s hard to say what makes people angry or upset enough to be part of a lawsuit. For some, country living conjures up pleasant images but farming and animal production are businesses: tractors are noisy and livestock produce waste. For displaced urbanites whose backgrounds are far removed from the farm, their perceptions of country life are often unrealistic.</span></p><p><span>Lower income families may feel they don’t have a voice, or aren’t comfortable addressing issues with their neighbors. They may have lived in a place for a long time, while their surroundings continued to change due to forces outside their control.</span></p><p><span>Those of us who grew up on farms have learned to take the pleasant with the unpleasant, recognizing that odors are a normal byproduct of livestock production. But even I appreciate the fact that our neighbors knife-in the manure from their facilities, and do everything they can to minimize odor.</span></p><p><span>In other words, they work hard to do the right thing.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>This is about farmers sitting down with neighbors, talking and taking steps to ensure quality of life for those around them. The very best operations hold open houses or appreciation events as a thank you to neighbors and customers. They practice the Golden Rule every day: Do unto others as you would have done to you.</span></p><p><span>Rural communities were built on how neighbors treated neighbors. Regardless of the size of your operation, that’s something you can’t forget.</span></p><p><span>And perhaps, through a well-planned effort on the part of each producer and the industry, maybe the next potential lawsuit can be avoided.</span></p>',

    body: '<p><span>Manure and urine collects inside hog barns at Kinlaw Farms in Bladen County. The farm, which raises nearly 15,000 hogs for Smithfield, generates more than 153,000 pounds of feces each day.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There were no scratch ’n’ sniff cards. No fetid fragrance strips like those frequently found in fashion magazines. No pictures of the stench, since it’s impossible to photograph a smell.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Yet in federal court this week, plaintiffs’ attorneys began their task of convincing a jury that the rancid odor of feces and urine emanating from an industrialized swine farm is not merely annoying. Rather, for the 10 plaintiffs who live within a mile of the farm in Bladen County, these intrusions meet the legal definition of a nuisance: an “excessive or unreasonable” impediment to the enjoyment of their private property.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And for the personal cost of enduring these nuisances, which include swarms of flies and a flotilla of trucks traveling down the gravel road at all hours of the night, the plaintiffs say they deserve to be compensated.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The first of several nuisance lawsuits against Smithfield Foods began Tuesday in U.S. District Court in Raleigh. The case focuses on Kinlaw Farms, which raises the nearly 15,000 hogs owned by Smithfield, and the alleged harm the operation is inflicting on the plaintiffs, 10 Black residents, many of them related and some of whom have lived on their land for more than 50 years. (Kinlaw isn’t being sued, only Smithfield.)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>But the subtext of the trial, which is expected to last four to five weeks, is the allegation that Smithfield, the world’s largest pork producer, puts profits over the concerns and health of its neighbors. In his opening statement, plaintiffs’ attorney Michael Kaeske depicted a corporation that throws around its political weight to help craft favorable environmental rules — regulations that allow Smithfield to keep using its outdated and polluting open-lagoon waste systems.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>(To make his point, Kaeske presented an internal Smithfield email that read, “At first, Angie [Maier of the NC Pork Council] and I talked about getting through again to [DEQ Secretary Donald] van der Vaart. Then we’re like, ‘Forget that. It’s time to tell the governor [Pat McCrory] to rein his secretary in.”)</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Smithfield has done nothing to make their lives better</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Better alternatives exist for managing waste, Kaeske argued, but Smithfield is too cheap to invest in them. “Smithfield has done nothing to make their lives better,” Kaeske told the jury.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>As for Smithfield, its attorneys have not yet begun to present their evidence. But in his opening statement, Mark Anderson of the powerful firm McGuireWoods — it also represents the Atlantic Coast Pipeline — painted a much different picture of the pork producer: benevolent, innovative, compliant with all state laws and permits — and a vital economic force for under-served areas of eastern North Carolina. No one has complained to state regulators, to Smithfield or to the Kinlaw family, Anderson argued. And the farm has no record of violations from the state.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In his opening statement, Anderson did acknowledge that hog farms smell. “Of course there are odors,” he said. But other people live near the farm — some have built new homes there — without incident.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Anderson tried to discredit the plaintiffs’ attorneys and witnesses, using code words like “community organizers” and “out of state people with agendas,” in an apparent attempt to appeal to any jurors’ sense of tribalism. “They are here because of other people’s agendas,” Anderson told the jury, referring to the plaintiffs. Later, he added: “There was harmony before the outside people came in.”</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>*******</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Ranging in age from 85 to their teens, the plaintiffs sat in the front row of the courtroom and viewed pictures of what was stinking up their neighborhood. Photos taken inside a hog barn at Kinlaw Farms show manure-smeared hogs crowded into feeding pens in a dark barn surrounded by manure-smeared walls and concrete floors soaked with pools of urine and feces. The hogs at Kinlaw Farms spend their entire lives in these conditions. And during that short time, just a few months, they produce more than 153,000 pounds of manure each day. It has to go somewhere.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>There was harmony before the outside people came in</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>These images, taken with Smithfield’s permission (although the company placed other restrictions on the scientist and photographer), lie in stark contrast to the clean, well-lit barn on the company website. The website also claims that it’s a “common misconception” that pigs wallow in their own manure, and that “slatted floors keep the barn clean.” But the pigs sleep in their own waste. They rub against each other, and as the manure dries on them, becomes dust. Manure also gets in the feed and its dust, which can affect the amount of odor released.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Shane Rogers, an environmental engineer and former EPA scientist, visited the farm last year as part of the lawsuit. He testified on behalf of the plaintiffs that wastewater from the lagoons — essentially manure-ridden water — is used to flush out the barns at Kinlaw.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Even though parts of the barns have slatted floors, manure and urine build up on the concrete. As these materials decompose, they create harmful gases: ammonia, hydrogen sulfide, volatile organic compounds, among them. These gases have to be released from the barns to keep the buildup from killing the hogs. In turn, the gases and the particles contained within them, including bacteria, viruses and other pathogens, then travel beyond the farm’s boundary.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Rogers, who now teaches at Clarkson University in upstate New York, tested the houses near the Kinlaw farm, he testified, and DNA analysis showed “for sure” the particles are “moving from the farm to the neighborhood.”</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The mixture of gases, he said, is “extremely powerful.”</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>And people’s sense of smell is subjective, Rogers testified. Merely measuring the level of ammonia in the air, for example, doesn’t necessarily indicate how badly it smells.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Anderson, representing Smithfield, had attempted to liken Kinlaw’s waste management system — flushing the barns with wastewater and emptying the manure and urine into open lagoons to be sprayed hundreds of feet in the air onto fields — to that at a research farm operated by NC State University off Lake Wheeler Road in Raleigh. Just three miles from the courthouse, Anderson argued, and yet people in downtown smelled nothing.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>However, Rogers had visited that research farm as well, and conducted studies there. The only similarity is that both facilities are farms. The NC State facility has 1,000 hogs; Kinlaw has nearly 15,000. The NCSU farm uses clean water to flush the barns, sharply reducing the odors. The university farm, unlike Kinlaw, also removes solid particles that go into the lagoon, also reducing the odor, and has a different treatment system.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It’s not a fair comparison,” Rogers said.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>While working for the EPA, in 2005, Rogers also studied how pathogens moved from spray fields into waterways. But the three-year project, conducted in North Carolina on a Smithfield-owned farm stalled. After $1.5 million had been spent on the study, the farmer backed out and the research team, not wanting to cause problems for him, withdrew, Rogers testified.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Why? asked Kaeske.</span></p><p><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“He said he was getting pressure from Smithfield not to continue the study,” Roger replied.</span></p>',

    body: '<p><span>The showdown between an eastern North Carolina hog farm and its neighbors continued Wednesday in the second day (not including a day dedicated to jury selection) of a trial about the odors and nuisance allegedly caused by industrial hog operations. The outcome of the trial could force the world&apos;s largest pork producer, Smithfield Foods subsidiary Murphy-Brown LLC, to change the way it manages its hog waste—an issue that has been a point of contention for the communities surrounding Murphy-Brown-operated hog farms for decades.</span><span></span></p><p><span>At its core, the trial is about pig poop. Plaintiffs suing the food giant argue that the farms&apos; method of disposing of hog waste has produced unbearable stenches. That waste-management system, which is common in large-scale hog farms in North Carolina, functions by storing excess pig excrement in open-air lagoons behind hog sheds and then liquifying and spraying the remaining waste onto nearby fields.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The result is smelly. (We know that because we have been to some of the homes of the plaintiffs suing Smithfield; you can read our series about the lawsuits and commercial hog farming </span><a href="https://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/hogwashed-part-1-hundreds-of-poor-mostly-african-american-residents-of-eastern-north-carolina-say-big-pork-is-making-their-lives-miserable/Content?oid=6825525"><b>here</b></a><span>.)</span><span></span></p><p><span>But just </span><i><span>how</span></i> <i><span>smelly</span></i><span> is at issue in this case. In opening statements, attorneys for Smithfield and the cohort of neighbors suing the company disagreed over what is more or less the central question: How unbearable are the smells produced at Smithfield-operated hog farms, and should those farms’ neighbors be financially compensated for the alleged nuisance the farms create?</span><span></span></p><p><span>The neighbors say yes; Smithfield says no.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>What happens in this trial could determine the outcome of twenty-five additional lawsuits filed by neighbors in 2014 against Murphy-Brown. The case currently being heard in court is the first of those lawsuits, which were split into eight parts by the judge presiding over the case. The first trial involves ten people who live near Kinlaw Farm, a large-scale hog operation in Bladen County that contracts with Murphy-Brown to raise its hogs.</span><span></span></p><p><span>The plaintiffs argue that the odors produced at Kinlaw have interfered with their health and quality of life and that the company should be forced to clean up the (literal) mess produced by thousands of hogs in confinement. Pigs produce five times as much waste as humans, and Murphy-Brown farms in North Carolina have long relied on the lagoon-to-sprayfield system to manage that waste. Attorneys for the plaintiffs say that the multibillion-dollar company has the financial resources to introduce alternative technologies to reduce the smell, such as covering the lagoons and eliminating spraying, but has done nothing.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>"Smithfield has the technology and the money to eliminate the odor," said Mike Kaeske, one of the plaintiffs’ attorneys. "Smithfield has chosen to do nothing."</span><span></span></p><p><span>An attorney for Smithfield, meanwhile, said the lawsuits are motivated by "out-of-town people with an agenda." (Industry trade groups and politicians, too, have characterized the litigation as an assault by avaricious attorneys on hardworking family farmers.) He also said that jurors shouldn&apos;t be asked to evaluate alternative waste-management technologies on other farms or broader issues related to the state&apos;s other Murphy-Brown operated farms. Instead, he argued, jurors should focus exclusively on the farm involved in this particular trial, Kinlaw, and whether or not it caused a nuisance to its neighbors.</span><span></span></p><p><span>"Why is it that they want to talk about all that other stuff but not about what his lawsuit is about?" He asked.</span><span></span></p><p><span>Smithfield&apos;s attorney used the same strategy yesterday during the pre-recorded cross-examinations of the first expert witness in the case, Steve Wing, an epidemiologist at UNC-Chapel Hill who spent years studying the public health impacts of industrial hog operations in Eastern North Carolina on its neighbors. Wing passed away from cancer in 2016, and his testimony was presented in a video in the courtroom, which the judge instructed jurors to give as much weight to as an in-person court testimony.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p><p><span>During his testimony, Wing discussed his research on communities living near hog farms, which included people who lived near Smithfield hog operations. Wing&apos;s research showed a correlation between air pollution from hog farms and higher rates of nausea, increases in blood pressure, respiratory issues such as wheezing and increased asthma symptoms for children, and overall diminished quality of life for people living nearby.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p><p><span>"If people aren&apos;t able to use their property, then it&apos;s a threat to public health," Wing said. He also stressed that Smithfield and others in the industry had the ability to learn about his research and other studies published about the impacts of industrial hog farms. "It&apos;s out there and available for them to see."</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>During cross-examination, an attorney for Smithfield made the point that Wing&apos;s research was not focused exclusively on Kinlaw Farms but rather the communities surrounding a range of eastern North Carolina hog farms (for example, Wing did not test the homes of the plaintiffs involved in this particular case and he didn&apos;t conduct air quality testing on Kinlaw Farm). The attorney also repeatedly asked if Wing&apos;s research distinguished between Murphy-Brown farms and other farms, which it did not.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Wing rejected the notion that those issues would somehow disqualify the relevance of his research, arguing that public health researchers often study communities affected by certain exposures and can draw conclusions about their impacts without studying every person exposed. Take, for example, lead cigarettes or lead exposure. There is now a large body of research documenting the lifelong, harmful effects of cigarette smoking and lead exposure. Researchers don&apos;t have to study every child exposed to lead or the lungs of every person who has ever smoked to draw the conclusion that those exposures are harmful.</span><span></span></p><p><span>As for his study&apos;s focus on neighborhoods affected by industrial hog operations rather than specific Murphy-Brown-operated farms, Wing made an analogy to researchers studying cigarette smoking. If he were studying the impacts of cigarette smoking, he explained, he would not need to study people who smoke Marlboros versus other brands of cigarettes.</span><span></span></p><p><span>"The impacts don&apos;t depend on separating out each brand because the constituents are similar enough," he said. "I don&apos;t think we could have done our research if we proposed only to study Murphy-Brown facilities."</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>Smithfield&apos;s attorney also said that some of the people Wing studied were assisted by community organizers adverse to the commercial hog farming industry and asked why they did not test every home in every neighborhood.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p><p><span>"We did not have every home, which is universal in research done in epidemiology," Wing responded. (Occasionally, it sounded like he was slowly and painstakingly explaining basic concepts of health research to a high schooler.)</span><span></span></p><p><span>Today, the trial will feature the testimony of a second witness, Shane Rogers, an expert in environmental engineering and animal waste management, </span><a href="https://www.indyweek.com/indyweek/court-documents-dna-samples-indicate-that-nc-hog-farms-sprayed-pig-feces-on-neighbors-homes/Content?oid=6209269"><b>whose tests have found that North Carolina hog farms literally sprayed liquified hog feces on their neighbors’ houses</b></a><span>.&nbsp;</span><span></span></p>',

Supporters see industrial-scale hog complexes as generating jobs and revenues in rural communities. Friendly lawmakers last year sought to retroactively sink the lawsuits by more than 500 neighbors now lined up to go to trial one after another.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Neighbors like Randy Davis contend the industry&apos;s long practice of storing liquid waste in what producers call lagoons, then spraying treated excrement onto nearby fields as fertilizer, spells misery for them.</span><span></span></p><p><span>"A lagoon is something that a pretty 15-year-old in the South Pacific swims in," said Davis, a state employee whose Green County home is about is about ¾ mile (1.15 kilometers) from the nearest impoundment. "This is not a lagoon. It&apos;s a cesspool. It&apos;s a 9-acre feces and urine pit."</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The plaintiffs&apos; attorneys also say that information uncovered about company influence campaigns show their "knowledge of the harmful health effects of its hog operations," the inadequacy of regulations to address those health effects, and the availability of feasible alternatives.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Pork producers say they not only care about their rural neighbors, but their operations are inspected annually to make sure they comply with environmental regulations. There are 14 state inspectors checking 2,100 hog operations.</span></p><p><span>Hog growers are keeping an eye on the litigation that could force them to make changes or part with big payouts.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>"Certainly we&apos;re watching it. There&apos;s some levels of concern in particular as it relates to possible impact to the economy" of the rural communities where the farms operate and pay wages, said Andy Curliss, CEO of the North Carolina Pork Council, a trade group.</span></p><p><span></span></p><p><span>The upcoming string of federal lawsuits target Murphy-Brown LLC, the hog production division of Virginia&apos;s Smithfield Foods. Smithfield was bought in 2013 by a division of China-based WH Group, the world&apos;s largest pork producer. China, with higher feed and labor costs than American pork producers, is one of the fastest-growing markets for U.S. exports and including Hong Kong now makes up about 9 percent, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The cases are being overseen by Judge W. Earl Britt, who was born 86 years ago in a town of about 130 people along the South Carolina border and joined the court in 1980 after Democratic President Jimmy Carter&apos;s nomination.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The first case to be tried next week involves 10 neighbors of Kinlaw Farm, a Bladen County hog operation located 10 miles (16 kilometers) east of a massive Smithfield Foods slaughterhouse. The farm and its owners, who raise hogs under contract with Murphy-Brown, are not defendants. Instead, the target is the company that set specific standards of how the farm must operate.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>The neighbors&apos; lawyers hand-picked the plaintiffs for this first trial. A second trial starting later this spring will involve parties selected by hog industry lawyers. The two sides will alternate choosing the players for further trials.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Such test cases allow lawyers to measure the strength of their evidence. The resulting verdicts - and any financial penalties - create guiderails for a possible settlement, said Christopher Seeger, a New York attorney who helped negotiate a $4.85 billion settlement over the health risks of arthritis painkiller Vioxx.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><span>Perhaps more important in shaping the ultimate resolution are the precedent-setting decisions judges make to accept some evidence and keep other details from jurors, Seeger said. Hog industry attorneys say the trial should be strictly limited to whether the 10 suing neighbors are suffering with a foul nuisance. They don&apos;t want jurors to hear about alternative disposal hog waste methods used elsewhere, industry lobbying, or evidence of Chinese ownership.</span></p><p><span>"You generate data from these bellwether trials that are very informative," Seeger said. "Where people would get more, where people would get less" based on how evidence persuades jurors.</span></p>',

    body: '<p><span style="font-size: small;">A major pork producer must live up to an agreement it signed 11 years ago and work on cleaning up water pollution tied to almost a dozen industry-scale hog operations, a federal judge ruled this week. Murphy-Brown LLC must end years of delay and have a mutually agreed consultant develop plans to fix problems at 11 sites identified in 2011, U.S. District Court Judge Malcolm Howard ordered on Monday. Environmentalists said the company-owned operations are in Bladen, Columbus, Duplin, Pitt, Sampson and Scotland counties.</span><span style="font-size: small;">The farms produce large amounts of manure and urine, which are flushed from barns into open-air waste ponds called lagoons and later applied to fields as fertilizer. "Considering that each of the farms were identified ... by conditions including lagoon leakage and elevated nitrogen concentrations, the corrective action is necessary to mitigate such conditions," Howard wrote. Murphy-Brown must allow the consultant to start collecting data needed to form clean-up plans for each operation, the judge ordered. The company had blocked the consultant from evaluating the 11 hog operations for more than three years, environmentalists said.</span><span style="font-size: small;">The order resulted after environmentalists went to court to force Murphy-Brown to live up to the company&apos;s 2006 agreement to clean up groundwater contamination at its eastern North Carolina hog operations. Murphy-Brown is the North Carolina-based livestock production subsidiary of Smithfield Foods Inc., which is owned by the Chinese company that is the world&apos;s largest pork producer. Hogs were a $21 billion industry nationwide in 2015, with North Carolina operations racking up $2.3 billion of that, according to the U.S. Agriculture Department. (Emery P.

    body: '<p>On April 6, 2015, the United States Supreme Court denied reviewed of a petition filed by CashCall, Inc. asking it to review a decision by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals denying arbitration.&nbsp; The plaintiff, Abraham Inetianbor, received a loan from Western Sky, a South Dakota company, which offered small loans at excessively high interest rates.&nbsp; Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Inetianbor was to repay the loan at an annual interest rate of 135%.&nbsp; Because Western Sky was owned by a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the loan agreement states that by signing it Mr. Inetianbor agreed to have any disputes resolved by arbitration before the Tribal Court. &nbsp;Arbitration is a way to resolve a dispute out of court.&nbsp; But there is no jury and most decisions by the arbitrator cannot be appealed.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In this case, the problem was the Tribe does not conduct arbitration and does not have any arbitration rules.&nbsp;</p><p>Mr. Inetianbor decided to sue CashCall, Inc, the company who took over the loan by Western Sky, because he had paid back the full amount of the money he borrowed plus some of the interest.&nbsp; CashCall insisted he pay back all of the interest owed, which was a lot of money because of the high interest rate. After Mr. Inetianbor filed the lawsuit in federal court in Florida, CashCall tried to have the case dismissed so that it could be arbitrated before the Tribal Court.&nbsp; As mentioned above, the problem was the Tribe did not conduct arbitration and there were no rules for the parties to follow.&nbsp;</p><p>The judge initially ordered that the case had to be arbitrated.&nbsp; But thanks to the efforts of Mr. Inetianbor, who, on his own, uncovered the fact that the Tribe does not the conduct arbitration, and the hard work by attorneys at Wallace &amp; Graham who filed motions asking the court to reconsider its earlier decision, the federal judge ultimately ruled in plaintiff’s favor and concluded that arbitration was not possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>CashCall appealed the decision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Several&nbsp;<a href="https://wallacegraham.com/mona-lisa-wallace/" name="Mona Wallace">attorneys at Wallace &amp; Graham</a>&nbsp;wrote the brief on Mr. Inetianbor’s behalf and attorney, John Hughes, argued the plaintiff’s position to the appellate court.&nbsp; The Court ruled in favor of Mr. Inetianbor.&nbsp; It concluded that because loan agreement required the Tribe to arbitrate using its consumer dispute rules and that these were important parts of the loan agreement, arbitration was unavailable.&nbsp; There was no way for the parties to comply with the terms of the loan agreement because the Tribe did not conduct arbitrations and it did not have any rules on arbitration.&nbsp; This was a huge victory for consumers because courts typically will order arbitration if the parties contract contains an arbitration clause.&nbsp;</p><p>CashCall then asked the United States Supreme Court to hear the case and decide whether the Eleventh Circuit was wrong in holding that arbitration was unavailable in this case.&nbsp; Mr. Inetianbor, through its attorneys at Wallace &amp; Graham, filed a brief opposing the petition.&nbsp; Wallace &amp; Graham argued that the Eleventh Circuit correctly held that arbitration was unavailable in this case and that Mr. Inetianbor should be allowed to pursue his claim in federal court.&nbsp;</p><p>The United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of Mr. Inetianbor by refusing to hear the case.&nbsp; &nbsp;As a result, the case was remanded back to the federal court in Florida for trial.&nbsp; This was another great victory for Mr. Inetianbor and&nbsp;<a href="https://wallacegraham.com/" name="Wallace and Graham of salisbury nc">Wallace &amp; Graham</a>, who has fought hard for the rights of consumers to have their cases heard in a court of law.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>',

    body: '<p>One of the most common questions we get from clients who are thinking about applying for Social Security Disability is: does my age affect my Disability benefits?&nbsp; The short answer is yes.&nbsp; In fact, very much so in some cases.&nbsp; To be clear, this is not to dissuade a younger disabled individual from applying for benefits, but simply to illustrate the effect that one’s age can have on his or her application for Disability benefits. &nbsp;</p><p>The Social Security Administration (SSA) uses many factors to determine whether an applicant is disabled, but one of the initial factors the SSA takes into account is the applicant&apos;s age.&nbsp; If an applicant does not meet a “listing,” which is a per se disabling medical condition (such as an advanced cancer) regardless of age, the applicant&apos;s age then determines the level of analysis used by the SSA to decide if the applicant is disabled.</p><p><strong>Those levels are as follows:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;<strong>Ages:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classifications:</strong></p><p>18-44 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young individual</p><p>45-49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Younger individual</p><p>50-54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closely approaching advanced age</p><p>55-59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advanced age</p><p>60-65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closely approaching retirement age</p><p>66+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retirement age</p><p>Stated simply, the older the individual, the easier it is to qualify for Disability benefits.&nbsp; The SSA believes that “young” and “younger” individuals can more easily train for another job, perhaps one that is less physically demanding than a prior one he or she can no longer perform due to certain conditions.&nbsp; If he or she can train for and perform the less-demanding or different type job, the SSA is not likely to find that person disabled under the law.&nbsp;</p><p>Likewise, the SSA recognizes that it could be very difficult for an older individual to train for a new job in which their past work skills may not easily transfer.&nbsp; Therefore, if someone of age 60-65 is unable physically to perform prior work, the SSA will likely find that person disabled even if he or she might could physically do a different, less demanding job.</p><p>If you are considering applying for Social Security Disability benefits, it is important to first discuss this with an attorney experienced in this field.&nbsp; Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to&nbsp;<a href="contact-us">contact our office</a>&nbsp;for a free consultation.</p>',

Despite attempts to comply with arbitration, the Tribe explained to Mr. Inetianbor and the district court on multiple occasions that the Tribe does not authorize arbitration.&nbsp; CashCall argued that the specified arbitral forum was not integral to the agreement, and therefore its unavailability should not cause the court to deny its motion to compel. The Court looked to “how important the term was to one or both of the parties at the time they entered into the agreement” – to determine whether the arbitration agreement is integral. In this case, the agreement made multiple references to the Tribe. In nine paragraphs regarding arbitration in the contract, the Tribe was specifically mentioned in five of them. The Court concluded that the contract’s use of “shall” and “is required to” was sufficient evidence of the intent to make the Tribal arbitral forum the exclusive forum.&nbsp; Since that arbitral forum was unavailable, Appellant’s motion to compel arbitration was denied.&nbsp;<a href="https://02ec4c5.netsolhost.com/Blog/data/20/1/142/136/1957625/user/2137514/htdocs/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Inetianbor-11th-Cir-10.2.14.pdf" data-cke-saved-href="https://02ec4c5.netsolhost.com/Blog/data/20/1/142/136/1957625/user/2137514/htdocs/Blog/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Inetianbor-11th-Cir-10.2.14.pdf">&nbsp;Inetianbor v.

    body: '<p>It isn’t often one can say that something exciting and positive is happening in cancer treatment but there is good news with immunotherapy. The science and treatments are changing rapidly. What is so amazing is that the source of this change is hidden within our own bodies. Cancer Immunotherapy is at the forefront of the battle to fight and perhaps cure certain types of cancer.</p><p>What is Cancer Immunotherapy and how does it work? It is quite complex but basically Immunotherapy is treatment that uses certain parts of a person’s own immune system to fight diseases including cancer. This can be done a few different ways.</p><p>First, doctors determine how to stimulate your own immune system to work harder or smarter to attack cancer cells. Secondly, doctors are developing drugs that give your immune system components and weapons to use, such as man-made immune system proteins.</p><p>Multiple tests and studies are ongoing and reports of positive results continue to trickle in.</p><p>For a long time, since the late 1800’s, doctors and scientist suspected that a person’s own immune system could affect certain cancers. Even before the immune system was well understood, William Coley, MD, a New York surgeon, first noted that getting an infection after surgery seemed to help some cancer patients. The ability to think outside the box and to always think proactively helped Dr. Coley as he began treating cancer patients by infecting them with certain kinds of bacteria. This came to be known as Coley Toxins.</p><p>Although he had some success, his technique was overshadowed when other more drastic forms of cancer treatment, such as radiation therapy, came into use. We have all heard about how awful chemotherapy and radiation are and the side effects they cause including hair loss, fatigue, and loss of appetite to name a few. Hopefully, the new therapy will work better, quicker and be less damaging to the parts of the body that are not infected with cancer.</p><p>Thankfully, science and medicine continue to explore immunotherapy. A recent Wall Street Journal article entitled&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Cancer Super-survivors: How Immunotherapy is transforming Oncology</span>, described a growing group of “super-survivors” who are transforming the world of oncology. In both total numbers of survivor’s and time of survival, the super-survivors are charting new territory. They are reviving hopes that the long-maligned idea of enlisting the power of one’s own immune system against cancer may help to turn the tide against some of the most lethal and resistant forms of the disease.</p><p>Since Coley’s Toxins were used in the late 1800’s doctors and scientists have learned a great deal about the immune system and how it might be used to treat cancer. Advances are rapid and there are numerous startup companies working in the field. It is complex, highly technical and very expensive. Treatments can total well over $120,000 per treatment and some average $12,500 per month or $150,000 a year. Hopefully the cost will go down as the drugs are developed.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In the last few decades immunotherapy has become an important part of treating some types of cancer. Newer types of immune treatments are now being studied for many other types, and they’ll impact how we treat cancer in the future. Immunotherapy includes treatments that work in different ways. Some boost the body’s immune system in a very general way. Others help train the immune system to attack certain cancer cells specifically. Your immune system is a collection of organs, special cells, and substances that help protect you from infections and some other diseases. Immune cells and the substances they make travel through your body to protect it from germs that cause infections. They also help protect you from cancer in some ways.</p><p>It may help to think of your body as a castle. Germs like viruses, bacteria, and parasites are like hostile, foreign armies that are not normally found in your body. They try to invade your body to use its resources, and they can hurt you in the process. Your immune system is your body’s defense force. It helps keep invading germs out, or kills them if they do get into your body. The immune system keeps track of all of the substances normally found in the body. Any new substance in the body that the immune system doesn’t recognize raises an alarm, causing the immune system to attack it. Substances that cause an immune response are called antigens. The immune response can destroy anything containing the antigen, such as germs or cancer cells.</p><p>Two Cancer Immunotherapy drugs being developed by major drug companies have proved remarkably effective against blood cancer Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. This adds to the growing evidence of the potential for enlisting the immune system in the fight against a wide range of tumors. The drugs are among an emerging class of agent’s know as immune checkpoint inhibitors which have shown the most promise against skin cancer and Lung cancer.</p><p>Wallace &amp;Graham is watching this closely as we represent victims of asbestos exposure who suffer from lung cancer. We are hopeful this promising research can be used to help our clients survive this occupational disease and are looking to see if it can apply to treatment of mesothelioma. &nbsp;</p><p>Tumor cells are very clever and they develop mechanisms that allow them to persist and not be seen effectively by T cells. If you can inhibit that mechanism you are unleashing the “T” cells and you are able to mount an immune response against the tumor. &nbsp;</p><p>For more information on this please read the American Cancer Society’s research papers on the latest developments in Cancer Immunotherapy.</p>',

Researchers said, that the longer the bacteria remain in workers’ noses, the greater the potential the bacteria will be spread to hog workers’ families and communities.&nbsp;Researchers reported that workers carrying staphylococcus aureus bacteria were antibiotic-resistant, likely due to antibiotics being used to promote hog growth as well as to treat sick animals.&nbsp;&nbsp;Staph cause more serious skin infections or can infect surgical wounds, the bloodstream, the lungs or the urinary tract. Strains of staph such as MRSA, which are resistant to some antibiotics, can be the most damaging because they can be so hard to treat.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://lawblog.wallacegraham.com/north-carolina-department-of-environment-and-natural-resources-issued-a-swine-waste-management-general-permit/" data-cke-saved-href="https://lawblog.wallacegraham.com/north-carolina-department-of-environment-and-natural-resources-issued-a-swine-waste-management-general-permit/">Read more here</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p>',

Importantly in 2010, the Food and Drug administration (FDA) stated that, “existing data raises valid concerns about the health effects of repetitive daily human exposure to Triclosan” and announced plans to address the use of Triclosan in cosmetics or other products. To date it has taken no action and FDA is now also facing criticism for not doing its due diligence in studying the chemical before it was approved.&nbsp;</p><p>It is promising that, as a direct result of pressure from consumer groups regarding the elimination of Triclosan in consumer products along with the mounting scientific evidence documenting its established adverse health effects, major manufacturers have quietly reformulated their products without Triclosan.</p><p>Be sure you know what you are using and research it prior to use. Companies seem to always want to sell it first and research it later.</p>',

Diesel exhaust has also been linked to pancreatic and bladder cancer. After a week-long meeting of international experts, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the World Health Organization (WHO), classified diesel engine exhaust as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), based on sufficient evidence that exposure is associated with an increased risk for lung cancer. WHO based its findings on research in high-risk workers including railway workers and others industrial workers exposed to diesel exhaust.</p><p>Similarly, American scientists have also found an increased risk of developing lung cancer in workers exposed to diesel fuel exhaust. A recent study found evidence that diesel exhaust exposure supports it as a cause of lung cancer in industrial workers and represent a potential public health burden.

Diesel exhaust exposure places the worker at risk for cancer. This risk has been studied and known for years yet many industries have simply ignored the risk and not instituted safety measure or discontinued use of diesel equipment in favor of equipment with safe levels of emission.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For decades, industry has relied upon diesel engines as a “cheaper” alternative to gasoline powered vehicles and ports, railroad yards and powerhouse industries have widely used heavily polluting diesel engines in its trucks, cranes, ships, trains and other equipment. In the process, industry needlessly over-exposed countless workers, drivers, mechanics, conductors, engineers and others to cancer causing pollution in doses sufficient to cause cancer and in doses that are much greater than the public exposure.</p>',
