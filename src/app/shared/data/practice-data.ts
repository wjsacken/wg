    category: 'Practice Areas',
    content: '<div class="sixteen columns"><h3><strong>DRUG AND DEVICE FOCUS:</strong></h3><p>Wallace and Graham lawyers are investigating a number of claims involving potential dangers and side effects from certain drugs and devices.&nbsp; The medications involved may be over-the-counter medicines or doctor-prescribed.&nbsp; The devices include things such as knee and hip implants and others.&nbsp; These are the current claims we are investigating:&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Allergan Breast Implants</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Allergan Biocell implants are saline-filled and silicone-filled textured implants.&nbsp; Claimants allege that Allergan Inc. and its subsidiaries did not properly warn women that their textured breast implants carry a risk of a type of cancer called breast implant-associated anaplastic large cell lymphoma, or BIA-ALCL.&nbsp; BIA-ALCL is a type of non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma (cancer of the immune system). &nbsp;Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have received an Allergan textured breast implant and have been experiencing side effects of any kind.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Belviq&nbsp;/ Lorcaserin</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Belviq, or Lorcaserin, is a weight loss drug to treat obesity. &nbsp;It was also prescribed to overweight people who had serious health conditions such as diabetes and high blood pressure.&nbsp; We are evaluating claims by clients who have been diagnosed with cancer after taking Belviq or Lorcaserin.&nbsp; Types of cancer named in Belviq lawsuits include:&nbsp; Pancreatic cancer, colorectal cancer, lung cancer.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Elmiron</strong></h4><p>Elmiron is a drug used to treat interstitial cystitis, also called &ldquo;IC&rdquo; or &ldquo;painful bladder syndrome.&rdquo; &nbsp;This is especially a problem for women.&nbsp; Claimants have alleged injuries from use of the drug including vision problems and blindness, macular (eye-related) degeneration, maculopathy, retinal injury.&nbsp; Elmiron is also known as pentosan polysulfate sodium (PPS). Women who have taken Elmiron for the pain and discomfort caused by IC have in some cases reported experiencing progressive eye disease that may result in permanent vision loss.&nbsp;</p><p>Signs of Elmiron-associated eye damage may include: Difficulty reading, hard time adapting to dim lighting, blurred vision, dark spots in center of vision, lines in vision, loss of colors in your vision.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have complications after receiving Elmiron.</p><h4><strong>FLUOROQUINOLINE</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p>Fluoroquinolones are antibiotics. They used to treat and prevent diseases caused by bacteria, like lower respiratory tract infections, skin infections, urinary tract infections, inflammation of the prostate, sinusitis, and gonorrhea.&nbsp; Fluoroquinolones are sold as tablets, capsules, injectables, ear drops, eye drops and inhalers.&nbsp; Brand names can include:&nbsp; Avelox (moxifloxacin), Baxdela (delafloxacin), Cipro (ciprofloxacin), Factive (gemifloxacin), Floxin (ofloxacin), Levaquin (levofloxacin), Noroxin (norofloxacin).&nbsp; The dangers associated with these drugs can include an aortic aneurysm.&nbsp; That is a bulging or ballooning in the wall of the aorta, which is the major artery carrying blood from the heart to other parts of the body. If an aneurysm grows large, it can burst and cause bleeding or death. Also, there are reports of use of the drug causing an aortic dissection, meaning a tear in the wall of the aorta. &nbsp;Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have suffered an aortic dissection or aortic aneurysm after taking a brand-name fluoriquinolone antibiotic.</p><h4><strong>Hip Replacements </strong></h4><p>Many people get hip replacements when their hip joints are damaged by arthritis, a fracture, or other condition.&nbsp; Hip replacements can use metal, plastic and ceramic parts.&nbsp; Some patients have received &ldquo;Metal-on-Metal Hip Implants&rdquo; which use a metal cup liner.&nbsp; But some patients report that their metal-on-metal hip implants fail prematurely.&nbsp; Also, there are reports that metal-on-metal devices can release metal particles into the bloodstream, a condition called metallosis, which causes inflammation and bone erosion. &nbsp;When hip implants fail prematurely, there also can be risks in having a second replacement surgery.&nbsp; These risks can include blood clots, infections, and other problems. &nbsp;Patients with metal-on-metal hip implants who experience hip/groin pain, noise, difficulty walking or a worsening of previous symptoms should see their orthopedic surgeon for further evaluation. &nbsp;These implants are manufactured by various companies.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have been injured by a metal-on-metal hip replacement.<strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><h4><strong>HVC bone cement (in knee replacements)</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p>Total knee replacements are a common knee surgery to help patients regain quality of life.&nbsp; The problem is that sometimes issues result from the bone cement that is used to attach the implant to the bone.&nbsp; Patients who have a bone cement failure may have to get a new surgery to remove and replace the device. &nbsp;Symptoms of bone cement failure can include: Instability, implant loosening, swelling at the joint site, loss of range of motion, and pain.&nbsp; These problems can be associated with the use of &ldquo;high-viscosity cement&rdquo; or &ldquo;HVC&rdquo; which sometimes is used because it hardens faster during the replacement surgery.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have had problems after a knee replacement surgery as described.&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Incretin Mimetics (Januvia, Victoza, Janumet and Byetta)&nbsp; </strong></h4><p>Many Type 2 diabetes patients take drugs called Incretin Mimetics.&nbsp; The brand names include Januvia, Victoza, Janumet and Byetta.&nbsp; Some patients taking these drugs have reported developing pancreatitis, and, pancreatic cancer.&nbsp; Januvia is a prescription pill that helps adults with Type 2 diabetes lower their blood sugar levels. It is generically known as sitagliptin. Victoza is a daily injection for Type 2 diabetes. It is generically known as liraglutide. Janumet is a medication in tablet form. It contains both sitagliptin and metformin.&nbsp; Byetta is an injectable medicine for adults with Type 2 diabetes, generically known as exenatide.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have taken one of these drugs and developed pancreatitis or pancreatic cancer.</p><h4><strong>IVC BLOOD CLOT Filters</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p>IVC filters are tiny, metal cage-like devices that are implanted into the inferior vena cava.&nbsp; That is a large vein in the body that delivers blood from the lower body to the heart. These implanted devices help to capture blood clots that can form in the legs, called deep vein thrombosis.&nbsp; IVC filters can be implanted in patients who are at risk for pulmonary embolism or blood clots.&nbsp; Such patients can include people recovering from accidents or surgeries, people who cannot use blood thinners, bariatric (weight loss), trauma and orthopedic patients.&nbsp; There are many brands and manufacturers of these devices. Patients who receive an IVC filter implant can experience complications including device migrations (the device moves), embolizations (it moves and fragments), perforations (it moves and makes a cut or hole), and filter fractures.&nbsp; These problems can result in stroke, heart attack, puncture of internal organs, puncture of blood vessel and death. &nbsp;Lawsuits have been filed for victims who claim they received an IVC filter and had resulting injury or death. &nbsp;Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have had an IVC filter installed and experienced these complications.</p><h4><strong>Juul Lawsuits</strong></h4><p>Many people think of &ldquo;vapes&rdquo; as good things because they can help people to stop smoking. &nbsp;But there is a dark side to these devices.&nbsp; Consumer health advocates say that the company that makes JUUL vape devices has targeted teens and children to become a new generation of nicotine addicts.&nbsp; Vapes are not as safe as many people believe, especially for the young.&nbsp; The liquid inside JUUL cartridges contains glycerol, propylene glycol, flavoring, benzoic acid, and nicotine.&nbsp; Studies show that nicotine can be as addictive as cocaine and even more addictive than alcohol. &nbsp;Worse, it can be toxic to fetuses and can impair brain and lung development if vapes are used by teenagers.&nbsp; Our firm is investigating claims of young people using JUUL vapes and experiencing nicotine poisoning, seizures, strokes and other injuries.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Knee Replacements</strong></h4><p>Our attorneys are investigating cases where clients have had a knee replacement surgery, but then they had to have a second replacement on the same knee because their first knee implant loosened or failed early. &nbsp;Many people have received a knee replacement implant device using parts and cement.&nbsp; But then, for some patients, their implant prematurely fails. &nbsp;The symptoms include infection and loosening. &nbsp;In some cases, the reason for the failure is that the first implant was defective or the cement failed.&nbsp; Patients who have to get a second unnecessary replacement surgery on top of the first one can suffer complications like bone loss, muscle damage, nerve damage and infection.&nbsp; Signs of knee implant failure include: that the knee feels unstable or like it is going to give out, there are popping, clicking or crunching sounds, and joint pain or swelling.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have had a first knee implant and have now had to have a second in the same place.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Ocaliva</strong></h4><p>Ocaliva is a drug used to treat primary biliary cholangitis (PBC).&nbsp; This is a liver disease that causes the bile ducts to become inflamed, leading to liver damage.&nbsp; Unfortunately, individuals taking Ocaliva for their chronic liver disease may face an increased risk of serious liver injury and death.&nbsp; These patients may have taken large doses of Ocaliva on a daily basis. &nbsp;The kinds of symptoms that can show a liver injury include abdominal pain and swelling, bloody stools, changes in behavior, loss of appetite, nausea and vomiting, yellow eyes or skin and others. Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who experienced worsening symptoms after taking Ocaliva.</p><h4><strong>Onglyza and Kombiglyze XR</strong></h4><p>Onglyza and Kombiglyze XR are medications used to treat Type 2 diabetes.&nbsp; Lawsuits have been filed that allege use of the drugs can cause heart failure and cardiac injuries. The drug makers include Bristol-Myers Squibb and AstraZeneca.&nbsp; These brand name drugs contain an ingredient called saxagliptin.&nbsp; The claimants allege the medications can cause heart problems and death.&nbsp; Claimants are patients who took Onglyza and Kombiglyze XR and who suffered heart failure or congestive heart failure.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have taken one of these drugs and reported heart failure afterwards.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Physiomesh Hernia Mesh </strong></h4><p>Many patients have had hernia mesh implants to address their hernia issues.&nbsp; However, there have been reports of hernia mesh failures that can lead to serious injuries. &nbsp;When the hernia mesh fails, it can require people have additional surgeries.&nbsp; Claimants in hernia mesh lawsuits have sued manufacturers including Bard, Ethicon and Atrium.&nbsp; Some of the brand names include Ethicon Physiomesh, Proceed, PHS, and Prolene.&nbsp; The kinds of injuries reported include that the hernia mesh adheres or sticks to internal tissue, that it causes bowel obstruction, problems with infection, mesh failure, mesh moving from where it was put in, and problems leading to a need for follow-up surgeries.&nbsp; Our law firm is investigating claims of hernia mesh failure and injury.</p><h4><strong>NEXIUM, PRILOSEC, DRUGS FOR STOMACH ACID</strong></h4><p>There are strong prescription and over-the-counter medications available for gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), heartburn, ulcers, esophagitis and other conditions arising from too much stomach acid. &nbsp;However, some of these medicines have been linked to serious injuries including acute interstitial nephritis, chronic kidney disease, kidney failure and other effects.&nbsp; The brands that are involved include Nexium (esomeprazole), Prilosec (omeprazole), Dexilant (dexlansoprazole), Prevacid (lansoprazole), and Protonix (pantoprazole).&nbsp; These drugs are used to control stomach acid.&nbsp; The claim is that they cause serious side effects that damage kidneys, causing kidney disease, kidney injury, kidney failure, and acute interstitial nephritis.&nbsp; Signs of kidney disease and failure may include too much or not enough urine, swelling in legs, feet ankles and around the eyes, fatigue, shortness of breath, cramps, nausea and vomiting, and other problems. Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have taken such a medication to reduce stomach acid and suffered severe injuries including chronic kidney disease, an acute kidney injury, renal failure, or acute interstitial nephritis.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Roundup (Monsanto)</strong></h4><p>Monsanto&rsquo;s Roundup is a commonly used weed killer.&nbsp; Unfortunately, reports have linked it to cancer. Some Roundup users allege that they developed a cancer known as non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma from the weed killer. &nbsp;The Roundup herbicide is made with glyphosate, an agricultural chemical.&nbsp; Studies indicate it can be cancer-causing.&nbsp; Roundup has been linked to lymphatic cancers like non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma among farmers, agricultural laborers and gardeners.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have contracted non-Hodgkin&rsquo;s lymphoma after using Roundup. &nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Stevens-Johnson Syndrome and Associated Drugs</strong></h4><p>Stevens-Johnson Syndrome (SJS) is a form of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN).&nbsp; This involves a severe adverse reaction of skin and mucous membranes following the use of some medications. &nbsp;SJS can lead to flu-like symptoms followed by a spreading red and purple rash and blisters that eventually cause the top layer of skin to die and shed. &nbsp;If this disorder is not treated it can lead to blindness, hearing loss, organ failure and death.&nbsp; Some of the medications associated with Stevens-Johnson Syndrome include Acetaminophen (Tylenol), Allopurinol, Carbamazepine (Tegretol), Celebrex, Dilantin, Phenytoin, Ibuprofen (Advil and Motrin).&nbsp; Treatment for Stevens-Johnson Syndrome can involve hospitalization in burn centers or surgical removal of damaged tissue. &nbsp;Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have taken one of these drugs and been diagnosed with SJS/TEN.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p><h4><strong>SURGICAL STAPLERS</strong></h4><p>Surgical staplers are used in many different kinds of surgeries.&nbsp; Many of these surgical staplers used in our hospitals are manufactured by Ethicon or Covidien.&nbsp; These devices are used to close wounds and surgical openings. &nbsp;However, they can jam up, misfire, injure tissue, or fail to close the wound. &nbsp;When this happens near sensitive tissues and organs, such as the gastrointestinal tract, heart, lungs, or kidneys, the consequences can be very bad. &nbsp;The complications from a surgical stapler failure can include death, sepsis, internal bleeding, damage to organs or the need for more surgeries.&nbsp; Claimants assert that the manufacturers of surgical staplers have known about these problems for years.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have been seriously injured by the use of a surgical stapler.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Talcum Powder</strong></h4><p>Research has linked talcum powder use to ovarian cancer and mesothelioma.&nbsp; The talc raw ingredient can be contaminated with asbestos and other contaminants.&nbsp; Products that contain talcum powder go beyond what you may think.&nbsp; They can include:&nbsp; Baby powder, body powders, Gold Bond, Summer&rsquo;s Eve powder, Nivea talc, perfumed powders, Shower to Shower and Cashmere Bouquet body powders, pressed cosmetic powders, face powder, eye shadows and blush, and others.&nbsp; Some of the brand names are Johnson&rsquo;s Baby Powder, Cashmere Bouquet, Gold Bond, Summer&rsquo;s Eve, and Nivea.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by individuals who have used talc products and developed ovarian cancer or mesothelioma.</p><h4><strong>Taxotere</strong></h4><p>Taxotere is a chemotherapy drug used to treat breast cancer and other cancer.&nbsp; It is also called docetaxel and is used in chemotherapy for breast cancer, non-small cell lung cancer, advanced stomach cancer, head and neck cancer, and metastatic prostate cancer.&nbsp; Taxotere is manufactured by Sanofi-Aventis.&nbsp; The chemotherapy is administered intravenously. &nbsp;However, for some patients, it has been linked to causing not just temporary but permanent hair loss, or alopecia.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by women who took the chemotherapy drug Taxotere and have suffered from permanent hair loss or alopecia.</p><h4><strong>TDF -- TENOFOVIR</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></h4><p>Gilead&rsquo;s drug tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) belongs to a class of antiretroviral drugs known as nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitors.&nbsp; These drugs are prescribed to treat HIV and brand names include Truvada, Viread, Atripla, Complera, and Stribild. These drugs inhibit the activity of an enzyme involved in the progression of HIV.&nbsp; They can slow the progression of HIV and keep individuals healthy.&nbsp; Unfortunately, some individuals who have taken the drug were later diagnosed with kidney disease or bone density loss. &nbsp;Wallace and Graham attorneys are investigating claims involving people who took one or more of Gilead&rsquo;s TDF drugs and were later diagnosed by a physician with kidney issues or bone density loss.</p><h4><strong>Testosterone Replacement Therapy&nbsp;&nbsp; </strong></h4><p>Millions of men have taken some form of testosterone therapy to help boost their energy levels. &nbsp;Brand names can include AndroGel and Depo-Testosterone. But the use of testosterone therapy has been associated with serious conditions, including blood clots, stroke, heart attack and death.&nbsp; Our lawyers are investigating cases involving patients who took testosterone replacement therapy, but then suffered from serious complications, including heart attacks and strokes, while taking testosterone replacement therapy.</p><h4><strong>TVA MESH</strong></h4><p>Thousands of women have received transvaginal mesh implants to treat conditions such as pelvic organ prolapse and stress urinary incontinence.&nbsp; Sadly, for some there have been needless complications.&nbsp; The mesh is used for support, but unfortunately it can cause significant medical complications and pain, necessitating further treatment and surgery. &nbsp;Mesh complications can include erosion, nerve damage, pain, organ perforation, bleeding, infection, and autoimmune problems. Wallace and Graham is investigating claims of women who have received these TVA mesh implants and complain of severe pain, organ damage and other complications after receiving the devices.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Uloric (febuxostat)</strong></h4><p>Uloric is a gout medication.&nbsp; Gout is a form of arthritis. &nbsp;Gout is characterized by sudden, severe attacks of pain, swelling, redness, and tenderness in the joints, often in the feet and toes. However, the Uloric drug used to treat it has been linked to severe complications in some patients, including an increased risk of heart failure or even death.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating cases of individuals who have suffered or died from a heart attack, stroke, or another severe cardiac event after taking Uloric to treat gout.</p><h4><strong>VALSARTAN</strong></h4><p>Many individuals suffer from blood pressure issues.&nbsp; Valsartan, Losartan, and Irbesartan products have been used by patients with blood pressure problems. &nbsp;The adverse side effects of Valsartan may include cancer, kidney failure, liver failure, lowered white blood cell count, and angioedema (which means the swelling of certain tissues in the body).&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating cases of individuals who have taken Valsartan, Losartan, or Irebsartan, and then later have been diagnosed with cancer or other serious conditions.&nbsp;</p><h4><strong>Viagra and Cialis</strong></h4><p>Millions of men have taken Viagra, Cialis, Revatio or Adcirca.&nbsp; However, it has been reported that these medications can be associated with an increased risk for developing skin cancer, specifically melanoma.&nbsp; Our law firm is investigating people who were diagnosed with melanoma after taking Viagra, Revatio, Cialis or Adcirca.</p><h4><strong>VIBERZI</strong>&nbsp;</h4><p>Some patients who take Viberzi (also known as Eluxadoline) have had their gallbladder removed.&nbsp; For patients like that, reports have stated there may be an increased risk of serious and potentially fatal pancreatitis (inflammation of the pancreas). &nbsp;The issue came to light after reports of hospitalizations and deaths associated with patients who had taken Viberzi and who had a cholecystectomy, which is a procedure to remove the gallbladder.&nbsp; The symptoms of pancreatitis can include abdominal pain, back pain, fast heart rate, fever, loss of appetite, nausea, sweating, vomiting, and weight loss. &nbsp;Our law firm is investigating cases of individuals who suffered pancreatitis while on Viberzi in these situations.</p><h4><strong>Zantac Lawsuits</strong></h4><p>Zantac (ranitidine) is a drug taken to reduce the effects of chronic heartburn. It decreases the amount of stomach acid in the body.&nbsp; However, claimants have asserted that it is linked to an increased occurrence of cancer. &nbsp;The types of cancers that may be related to Zantac use include stomach, small intestine, colorectal, esophageal, liver and others.&nbsp; Our attorneys are investigating cases of individuals who took over-the-counter Zantac or another ranitidine products and later were diagnosed with cancer.</p><h4><strong>Zinbryta (daclizumab)</strong></h4><p>Some patients with Multiple Sclerosis (MS) have taken the medication known as Zinbryta (daclizumab).&nbsp; However, claims have arisen involving patients who took Zinbryta and then developed serious inflammatory brain disorders and other debilitating, and sometimes fatal side effects.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating cases involving individuals who suffer from MS, take Zinbryta and then develop a worsening, inflammatory brain disorder, such as encephalitis or meningoencephalitis.</p><h4><strong>Zofran</strong></h4><p>Women have been treated with Zofran during pregnancy for morning sickness.&nbsp; However, it has been claimed that after taking the drug, some women delivered babies with birth defects. &nbsp;Zofran is also known as Ondansetron.&nbsp; It has been used to treat morning sickness and pregnancy-related nausea and vomiting. &nbsp;The types of birth defects asserted to be linked to taking Zofran include structural heart defects, cleft lip, cleft palate and cranial defects.&nbsp; Wallace and Graham is investigating claims by women who took Zofran and then delivered children with birth defects.</p><h4><strong>ZOSTAVAX</strong></h4><p>The Zostavax medicine is a vaccine against shingles, also known as herpes zoster, which can afflict older people with a painful rash.&nbsp; However, some patients who have received the drug have complained of developing the shingles illness and other problems.&nbsp; The side effects from the drug may include shingles, chickenpox, headache, fever, hives, nerve damage and joint and muscle pain.&nbsp; More serious complications can include stroke, congestive heart failure, autoimmune disorders, hearing loss, vision loss, spinal cord inflammation, and even death.&nbsp; Our lawyers are investigating cases involving people who received the Zostavax vaccine, and later were diagnosed with one of the serious conditions noted above.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p></div>',

      content: '<div class="sixteen columns"><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Wallace and Graham specializes in environmental litigation to ensure North Carolinians have continued access to fresh water to drink and air to breathe. Most recently, our firm represented neighbors harmed by Duke Energy&rsquo;s water contamination with coal ash and neighbors harmed by Concentrated Animal Feeding Operations (CAFOs) interference with the use and enjoyment of their property.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Our firm is passionate about doing what we can to protect North Carolinians from environmental harms and disturbances, including corporate pollution, that affect their quality of life.&nbsp; Below is a summary of two significant environmental cases.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Please visit our </span><a href="https://justiceforcamplejeune.com/"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Camp Lejeune site</span></a><span style="font-weight: 400;"> to learn more about our continued fight to seek justice for victims of water contamination at Camp Lejeune.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>In Re Swine Farm Litigation</i></b><b>:&nbsp;</b><b>Verdicts in excess of $549 million for five jury trials</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the 1980s and 1990s, a building boom by the swine industry resulted in southeastern North Carolina counties being filled with large factory farms, often built without consideration of the rights and needs of families who lived in existing rural communities. The industry, which also had a stronghold on the state legislature, repeatedly beat back efforts to increase state or local regulation. When a bill was finally passed banning new farms, the industry successfully lobbied to have all of the existing ones grandfathered in.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As a result, rural areas, including many low-income communities of color, suffered for years. The unpredictable fumes, nauseating odors coming from millions of gallons of untreated hog waste, and heavy truck traffic significantly impacted the communities&rsquo; quality of life, and impaired the ability of families to use and enjoy their homes. Bouts of flies would interrupt outdoor activities. Filth leaked from trucks carrying live and dead hogs. Meanwhile, massive amounts of contaminants, bacteria and pathogens, ammonia, and other contaminants were released into the environment.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, attorneys at Wallace and Graham, along with talented co-counsel Mike Kaeske and Lisa Blue, stepped forward to represent residents of these impacted communities. After five years of scorched-earth litigation in federal court, the trials of the first selected bellwether plaintiffs began in April 2018 and concluded in March 2019.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The series of trials, each nearly a month long, resulted in unanimous jury verdicts holding Smithfield Hog Production liable for causing a substantial and unreasonable interference with the plaintiffs&rsquo; use and enjoyment of their homes under a common law claim of private nuisance. Four of the five juries also found liability for punitive damages.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The third jury verdict resulted in the largest damages award in North Carolina history, Smithfield -- the world&apos;s largest pork producer, and a multinational corporation based in China -- issued press releases promising to institute changes to its waste handling practices and implement green energy initiatives.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">If the company follows through on its commitments, it should help reduce the impairment of quality of life of nearby community members and help alleviate the public health risks.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We believe our efforts on behalf of hog farm neighbors will result in long-term benefits to our State and its citizens.</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><b><i>Brown , et. al. v. Duke Energy</i></b><b>:</b><b>&nbsp;Increased protections for over 400 neighbors of coal ash ponds</b></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As background, Duke Energy is the nation&rsquo;s largest public utility.&nbsp; Many of Duke Energy&rsquo;s energy plants burn coal to make energy.&nbsp; For decades, Duke Energy has stored the byproduct of burning coal, coal ash, in open, unlined ponds at its coal-fired power plants.&nbsp; In 2014, a coal ash spill at the Dan River plant exposed the potential for the heavy metals, including arsenic, lead, manganese, vanadium and other carcinogens, in ash to contaminate water, including the groundwater near the homes.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Families received &ldquo;do not drink&rdquo; letters, accompanied by supplies of bottled water for bathing and drinking purposes.&nbsp; Families were outraged and scared.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On August 23, 2017, Amy Brown of Belmont and Deborah Graham of Salisbury, along with representatives of other neighborhoods near Duke power plants, filed a class action lawsuit. The lawsuit sought injunctive relief and damages against Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC and Duke Energy Progress, LLC, and asked the court to determine the rights of the local homeowners and of Duke under a financial supplement agreement Duke offered.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After a lengthy process, W&amp;G was successful negotiating new releases and creating better terms and protections for families.&nbsp; Coal ash neighbors obtained the following relief:</span></p><ul><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Improved release forms which removed language that would have forced neighbors to agree that Duke had fully compensated them for all harm past and future;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preserved claims for children and employees;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Increased protection to the neighbors, placing the responsibility on accountable parties for damage or repairs arising during the city-water connections;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preserved claims for future damages or injuries;</span></li><li style="font-weight: 400;"><span style="font-weight: 400;">Preserved claims for all air, home, or non-ground water environmental contamination claims that may exist in the future caused by Duke Energy;</span></li></ul><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">By working together and cooperating, the clean water goals of the coal ash neighbors are continuing to be accomplished.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;</p><span style="font-size: 8pt;"><em><strong>*The results referenced on this page are not the only results the firms have achieved.&nbsp; Each case is different and must be evaluated on its individual merits.&nbsp; Prior results do not guarantee similar results can be achieved in future cases.*</strong></em></span></div>',

Filing a claim under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act (CLJA) will have no impact on your VA disability, widow or medical benefits. Similar to any other injury lawsuit, the law does allow for any amount of VA disability or Medicare/Medicaid benefits related to the illness giving rise to the CLJA claim to be offset from any award or settlement; however, the government could agree to waive that offset when that time comes. <span style="color: #0000ff;"><a href="filing-a-camp-lejeune-claim-affect-va-benefits" target="_blank" style="color: #0000ff;" rel="noopener noreferrer">Click here to read our detailed blog, further explaining how your claim will have NO impact on your VA benefits</a></span>.</p></div><div class="item"><h4>What If A Potential Claimant Died Many Years Ago?</h4><p>Deceased individuals, regardless of how long ago they passed away, can also qualify for a claim through their estate&apos;s personal representative. The Camp Lejeune Justice Act waives the statute of limitations defense, so a deceased&apos;s family may still recover if the death was related to the contaminated water.</p></div><div class="item"><h4>How Long Do We Have To File A Claim?</h4><p>The law will only allow individuals who qualify to file claims for&nbsp;<strong>TWO YEARS</strong>&nbsp;from the date this bill was signed into law (August 10, 2022). So, that means that your claim must be filed no later than August 10, 2024. Any claim filed after the deadline could be subject to dismissal, so please do not wait to act!</p></div><div class="item"><h4>Is This Only For Marines?</h4><p>No! This new law allows anyone who was exposed to the toxic Camp Lejeune water from 1953 to 1987 (for at least 30 days) to bring a claim. This includes Marines, their family members, civilian employees, and anyone else who was exposed.</p></div><div class="item"><h4>Where Will The Cases Be Filed?</h4><p>First, each claim must be filed administratively with the Department of the Navy&apos;s JAG office. If that office either denies the claim or fails to act on it within six months, it can then be filed only in federal court in the Eastern District of North Carolina. This is a court our firm is very familiar with and has tried many cases there with great success. All of our lawyers working on this case are already admitted to practice in the EDNC.</p></div><div class="item"><h4>Is This A Class Action Lawsuit?</h4><p>No. This is an individual claim for you or your loved-one. A class action involves a group of plaintiffs who have a similar injury. In this case, there are many different situations - some have died, some have become disabled, and some have recovered. Each of our clients&apos; situations are unique and we treat them as such.</p></div><div class="item"><h4>How Long Will This Take?</h4><p>We wish we knew! This is a brand new litigation based on a brand new statute, so there is naturally some uncertainty. Although our firm has litigated very similar occupational disease cancer cases before, nothing quite like the Camp Lejeune Justice Act has ever passed Congress. Once we begin to file our initial slate of cases, a judge gets assigned, and initial discussions are had with the Department of the Navy and Department of Justice, we will learn a great deal more. We are confident those agencies will work diligently to move these claims forward in as efficient a manner as possible.</p></div>',

    content: '<div class="sixteen columns"><h1>Your Estate and Your Will</h1><p>All too often, at our law firm we have heard of cases where individuals have passed away, or they have become mentally and physically incapacitated and unable to look after their own affairs, without having planned for those events.&nbsp; This can become a tragedy for their loved ones and their surviving family members.&nbsp; Truly, in this area, &ldquo;an ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p><p>It is certainly a difficult thing to think about and discuss with your loved ones topics involving your estate and your Will.&nbsp; But having certain properly-executed documents in existence can help to make sure that if a tragic event happens, your own wishes on a variety of issues can be followed.&nbsp; Having a good&nbsp;<a id="estate plan" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Estate_planning">estate plan</a>&nbsp;can substantially lessen the burden on your loved ones when tragic or unexpected events happen in your family.</p><p>When someone passes away without a<a id="last will and testament" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Will_and_testament">&nbsp;Last Will and Testament</a>, North Carolina law says how that individual&rsquo;s property is distributed and allows a range of individuals to act as the administrator of the estate of the person who has passed away.&nbsp; While these rules often match what someone would have put in their Will anyway, sometimes, they do not.&nbsp; Also, by using a Will and other Estate Planning tools, it is possible to reduce the confusion and expenses involved in handling an estate.</p><p>If you have a properly-executed Will, you can control who will administer your estate, how your remaining assets will be disbursed, and&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">you</span>&nbsp;can decide how best to distribute your assets and other property.&nbsp;</p><p>With a Will, you can specifically name whom you want to execute your will and administer your estate.&nbsp; You can also specifically instruct how each of your assets will be distributed.&nbsp; By having a thought-out estate plan and a Will, you can make sure that there is certainty in the event of a tragedy, and this can bring peace of mind to you and your loved ones.</p><p>The law sets certain requirements for a Will to be valid.&nbsp; We recommend that you seek the advice and counsel of a qualified attorney when you are preparing your own Will and your estate plan for you and your family.&nbsp;For more information call<a href="tel:800.849.5291">800.849.5291</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cs@wallacegraham.com?subject=Wills%20and%20Estates%20Website%20Visitor&amp;body=Name%3A%20%0APhone%3A%20%0AEmail%3A%20%0ABest%20time%20to%20contact%20you%3A%20">email us</a>, today!&nbsp;</p></div><hr /><div class="sixteen columns"><h2>Essential Part</h2><p>Executing a proper Will is an essential part of an estate plan.&nbsp; Along with a Will, we also recommend that our clients have a&nbsp;<a id="living will" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advance_health_care_directive">Living Will</a>&nbsp;(also commonly known as an &ldquo;advance directive&rdquo;) and a&nbsp;<a id="health care power of attorney" href="https://www.ncmedsoc.org/non_members/public_resources/hcpowerofattorney2007.pdf"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Health Care Power of Attorney</span></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>A &ldquo;living will&rdquo; allows you to direct, in writing, your doctors and family members, as to what to do and how far you want your doctors to go in prolonging your life if and when the time comes that they have reasonably determined that you will never recover from your illness nor regain consciousness or any quality of life.&nbsp; A &ldquo;living will&rdquo; can increase the certainty regarding the medical care and other arrangements to be undertaken if a catastrophic event occurs.</p><p>Without this document, disputes can arise among loved ones and medical providers, since they lack the certainty of knowing what you would have wanted them to do.&nbsp; However, with the guidance of a properly prepared living will, they are all bound by&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">your</span>&nbsp;decision and must act accordingly.&nbsp; This can provide peace of mind to you as well as them.</p><p>With a &ldquo;health care power of attorney,&rdquo; which works along with your living will, you can choose someone &ndash; typically, a spouse or adult child &ndash; to act as your &ldquo;agent&rdquo; in making important medical decisions if the day ever comes when you have been deemed mentally unable to make decisions and act on your own behalf by your doctors.&nbsp; This health-care &ldquo;agent&rdquo; also ensures that your living will is properly followed when and if the proper time comes.&nbsp;</p><p>North Carolina law and statutes specifically provide for the use of living wills and health care power of attorneys.&nbsp; We have found that these legal instruments are widely used and well-recognized as effective ways to provide guidance and certainty to families and loved ones dealing with difficult circumstances and serious illnesses.</p><p>Finally, we recommend that our clients have a&nbsp;<a id="power of attorney" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Power_of_attorney"><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Durable General Power of Attorney</span></a>.&nbsp; This is a document which, similar to the health care power of attorney, gives &ldquo;power&rdquo; to an individual of your choice &ndash; again, typically a spouse or adult child &ndash; to handle your financial affairs in the event that in the future you become physically or mentally unable to do so.&nbsp;</p><p>Those broad responsibilities can range from something as simple as paying monthly bills to selling or purchasing real estate. &nbsp;This document helps to ensure that your financial affairs are handled properly if the day comes when you are unable to manage them yourself.</p><p>In addition, the law provides for special steps to be taken in your estate plan to deal with a wide variety of other contingencies and issues.&nbsp; Special measures can be undertaken to set up a trust or make legal arrangements for your estate and your assets that can help to pass as much of your assets as possible to your loved ones and family and to avoid unnecessary taxes on these assets.&nbsp;</p><p>Further, the law provides for special approaches to structure an estate to address issues such as ensuring the future care of a disabled child, ensuring the proper transition of real estate and other properties, addressing foreseeable creditor claims and liens, and accounting for the need for nursing home or extended care facilities.&nbsp;</p><p>If you would like more information on these estate planning considerations and the legal options which may be available to you, please contact us at&nbsp;<a href="tel:800.849.5291">800.849.5291</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cs@wallacegraham.com?subject=Will%20%26%20Estate%20Website%20Visitor%20&amp;body=Name%3A%20%0APhone%3A%20%0AEmail%3A%0ABest%20time%20to%20contact%3A%20">email us</a>.&nbsp;</p></div>',
