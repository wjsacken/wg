CLJA claims&nbsp;</span><span>will not</span><span>&nbsp;have their VA benefits reduced because of any additional compensation from the CLJA.&nbsp; The spokesperson also said&nbsp;</span><b>"if a veteran is already receiving VA benefits as a result of disability related to contaminated water exposure at Camp Lejeune, their&nbsp;</b><b><i>court award</i></b><b>&nbsp;will be reduced by the value of those benefits."&nbsp;</b></p><p><i><span>Source:</span></i><span>&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.11alive.com/article/news/verify/government-verify/camp-lejeune-justice-act-2022-honoring-our-pact-act-water-how-to-file-claim-fact-check/536-b1e0baef-193f-429e-8e0a-8faf7ad78cbd\"><span>https://www.11alive.com/article/news/verify/government-verify/camp-lejeune-justice-act-2022-honoring-our-pact-act-water-how-to-file-claim-fact-check/536-b1e0baef-193f-429e-8e0a-8faf7ad78cbd</span></a><span>)</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Notably, the spokesperson for the VA correctly stated that the veterans’&nbsp;</span><b><i>“court award”</i></b><span>&nbsp;may be reduced --&nbsp;</span><b><i>not the veterans’ VA benefits</i></b><span>. &nbsp;This means that only once an individual receives a court award can the government seek any potential reduction (offset) to the award for VA benefits that individual has received.&nbsp; The government could also presumably waive the offset entirely in negotiations.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>We believe the Navy’s and the VA’s positions are consistent and in line with the CLJA statute. &nbsp;We are aware of no examples of any governmental agency taking contrary positions.&nbsp; So far, we are only aware of the Veterans of Foreign Wars (VFW) nonprofit organization taking a seemingly different position in a recent VFW Magazine article, referenced below.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>The offset provision in the CLJA clearly states:</span></p><p><span>(2)&nbsp;</span><span>H</span><span>EALTH AND DISABILITY BENEFITS RELATING TO WATER EXPOSURE.—</span></p><p><span>Any&nbsp;</span><b><i>award</i></b><span>&nbsp;made to an individual, or legal representative of an individual, under this section shall be&nbsp;</span><b><i>offset</i></b><span>&nbsp;by the amount of any disability award, payment, or benefit provided to the individual, or legal representative—</span></p><p><span>(A) under—</span></p><p><span>(i) any program under the laws administered by the Secretary of Veterans Affairs;</span></p><p><span>(ii) the Medicare program under title XVIII of the Social Security Act (</span><a href=\"http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=42&section=1395\"><span>42 U.S.C. 1395 et seq.</span></a><span>); or</span></p><p><span>(iii) the Medicaid program under title XIX of the Social Security Act (</span><a href=\"http://uscode.house.gov/quicksearch/get.plx?title=42&section=1396\"><span>42 U.S.C. 1396 et seq.</span></a><span>); and</span></p><p><span>(B)&nbsp;</span><b><i>in connection with health care or a disability&nbsp;</i></b><b><i>relating to exposure to the water at Camp Lejeune</i></b><b><i>.</i></b></p><p><i><span>(emphasis added)</span></i><span>&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<i><span>See</span></i><span>&nbsp;Sect. 804(d)(2)&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3373/text\"><span>https://www.congress.gov/bill/117th-congress/senate-bill/3373/text</span></a><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>We believe there are two key parts of this legislation directly relevant to this issue.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<b>Only An Award Can Be Offset.</b><span>&nbsp; First, the law clearly states that only a CLJA&nbsp;</span><b><i>“award”</i></b><span>&nbsp;(</span><i><span>i.e.</span></i><span>, settlement, verdict, etc.) can be offset, i.e.&nbsp;</span><i><span>reduced,</span></i><span>&nbsp;by whatever “amount of any disability award, payment, or benefit ... provided to the individual ... under any [VA-administered program, Medicare, or Medicaid].”&nbsp; Black’s Law Dictionary defines “offset” simply as “a reduction.”&nbsp; Therefore, according to the plain language of the statute, only a&nbsp;</span><i><span>CLJA award</span></i><span>&nbsp;shall be reduced by the amount of VA/Medicare/Medicaid benefits that the government can prove are related to the harm caused by contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.&nbsp; The purpose of an offset is to prevent a double-recovery, where the government would have to pay a veteran twice for the same damages.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<b>Only a CLJA-Related Benefit Is Subject to an Award Offset.</b><span>&nbsp; The second provision of importance&nbsp;</span><span>(sect. 804(d)(2)(B) highlighted above) clarifies that the veteran’s CLJA award could&nbsp;</span><i><span>only be reduced to the extent the veterans’ VA provided benefit was related to the same water-related illness</span></i><span>. For example, the government will have to prove that the VA benefit (e.g., health care or monthly disability benefits) was related to the veterans’ contaminated water disease/harm.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Example: If a veteran is on 100% disability for combat-related PTSD and a knee injury, but his/her CLJA award is for kidney cancer, the government would not be permitted to take any offset for monthly disability benefits from that veteran’s CLJA settlement because the government cannot prove the disability benefits are related to the harm caused by toxic water.&nbsp; There would be no “double recovery” for the veteran under those circumstances.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>In an opposite example, if a veteran is getting 100% disability for kidney cancer, and his/her CLJA award is also related to kidney cancer, then the statute states that the veteran’s CLJA&nbsp;</span><i><span>court award&nbsp;</span></i><span>may be reduced by the amount of benefits they have received from the VA for kidney cancer-related health care or disability.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<b><i>However, it is important to note that the reduction is only permitted</i></b>&nbsp;<b><i>up to</i></b>&nbsp;<b><i>the date of the claim&apos;s resolution because a reduction is only permitted on the award, not on VA benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</i></b><span>Even under this scenario, where the VA benefits were provided for the proven CLJA-related harm, there is no indication that the benefits can or would be reduced on an ongoing basis.&nbsp; Only the court award or settlement – not future VA benefits - would be reduced by the previous VA benefits provided.</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Key takeaways from this provision include:&nbsp;</span></p><span>-If you do not prevail in the case, your benefits will never be affected</span><span>-If you win your lawsuit and get a verdict or settlement from the U.S. Government,&nbsp;</span><i><span>only then</span></i><span>&nbsp;will the government be allowed a reduction of the award for already-provided VA benefits.&nbsp;</span><i><span>-But</span></i><span>&nbsp;in order to receive the reduction, the U.S. Government will have the burden of proving that the provided VA benefit was related to contaminated water at Camp Lejeune.</span><span>-There is little likelihood, if any, that a veteran would receive&nbsp;</span><span>no settlement</span><span>&nbsp;after the government reductions, as that would be inequitable&nbsp;</span><i><span>and</span></i><span>&nbsp;a settlement that no veteran or civilian would likely accept after being exposed unknowingly to contaminated water and suffering a terrible harm, disease, or cancer. &nbsp;</span><span>-There is a reasonably likely possibility that the government – as a part of a settlement – could waive the government’s entitlement to an offset or reduction, due to the complexity of analyzing each individual case for a reduction and their burden to prove that the benefit was related to the disease/harm caused by contaminated water.</span><p><span>It is important to note that the Camp Lejeune Justice Act statute is very different from how a contaminated water claim was brought under the Federal Tort Claims Act (FTCA).&nbsp; Pursuant to 38 U.S.C. § 1151, if a veteran is awarded any compensation from a FTCA claim related to the same injury/illness for which the veteran also receives VA benefits, the VA&nbsp;</span><i><span>can</span></i><span>&nbsp;suspend benefits until the full amount of the FTCA award is recovered.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>The language that is present in the Federal Tort Claims Act statute is not present in the Camp Lejeune Justice Act of 2022</span><span>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><i><span>Source:</span></i><span>&nbsp;38 U.S.C. § 1151 (b)(1);&nbsp;</span><a href=\"https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1151\"><span>https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/38/1151</span></a><span>.&nbsp; The Camp Lejeune Justice Act allows an offset on the award and&nbsp;</span><span>not</span><span>&nbsp;a suspension of benefits.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>In its recent Fall 2022 edition, VFW Magazine published an article and included quotations by VFW General Counsel John Muckelbauer causing veterans to believe that filing a claim under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act could potentially cause their VA benefits to stop or be suspended.&nbsp; VFW is a nonprofit veterans’ service organization (VSO).&nbsp; This nonprofit program has many members and has been wonderfully helpful and trusted to veterans for decades.&nbsp; However, it is not a governmental entity and is not involved with the administration of VA benefits nor is it the entity who is handling and/or litigating these claims on behalf of the United States (Department of Navy/Torts Claims Unit and Department of Justice (DOJ)).&nbsp; We have had conversations with Mr. Muckelbauer, who was kind enough to speak to us after the article was released, and we are continuing to work with the VFW and Mr. Muckelbauer to ensure that truthful and accurate information is circulated to veterans.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>Our firm encourages veterans to rely upon the plain language of the statute as well as the guidance which has been issued directly by the VA and Navy’s Tort Claims Unit which unequivocally states that claims filed under the Camp Lejeune Justice Act do not impact benefits or programs administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs.&nbsp; Any offset, or reduction, would only be to a court award to prevent “double recovery,” and only for VA benefits which are proven to be related to the harm caused by the contaminated water and have been received prior to the date of the award.&nbsp;</span></p><p>&nbsp;<span>If you continue to have any questions about whether filing a claim under the CLJA will affect your past or future benefits, please do not hesitate to contact our firm by emailing&nbsp;</span><a href=\"mailto:justiceforcamplejeune@wallacegraham.com\"><span>justiceforcamplejeune@wallacegraham.com</span></a><span>&nbsp;or calling or texting Wallace & Graham, PA in Salisbury, NC at 704-633-5244.</span></p>'

    blog: '<p><span>When you experience a</span><a href=\"http://www.autoaccident.com/personal-injury-damages-what-youre-able-to-recover.html\"> <span>personal injury</span></a><span> at the fault of another party, it can be life-altering. You might be faced with exorbitant medical bills, loss of income, and damage to your vehicle. In addition, if you experience disability as a result of your injury, you may soon realize that your loss of income will last much longer than just a few days or a few weeks. If you experienced any trauma as a result of your injury, you may need ongoing therapy or even inpatient services. If you lost your job, which is common following a serious injury, you may have lost access to benefits like health insurance, dental insurance, vision insurance, short-term disability, retirement savings, and more. In this blog post, we&apos;ll help you understand which damages you may be able to recover in North Carolina.</span></p><h3><span>Damages In Personal Injury Cases</span></h3><p><a href=\"http://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/types-of-compensation.html\"><span>Damages</span></a><span> vary greatly from one situation to another and will depend on the unique circumstances surrounding your personal injury. Some of the most common damages awarded to injured parties include:</span></p><ul class="list"><li><span>lost wages</span></li><li><span>loss of wages in the future, if you are unable to return to work</span></li><li><span>medical bills you&apos;ve incurred as a result of the injury or accident</span></li><li><span>the estimated cost of future medical bills</span></li><li><span>household expenses associated with your injury, such as modifications to the home to make it handicapped accessible</span></li><li><span>loss of companionship</span></li><li><span>mental anguish</span></li><li><span>pain and suffering</span></li><li><span>wrongful death, which can include compensation for funeral costs, burial expenses, medical care rendered before death, the emotional distress of loved ones, lost wages, and more</span></li></ul><p><span>In some cases, additional categories of compensation like property damage repairs and punitive damages may also apply. Punitive damages are extended with the intent of punishing the defendant for particularly egregious behavior (and may be used to set an example and deter others from engaging in similar behavior in the future). The exact damages that may apply in your case will depend on the specific details of your situation.&nbsp;</span></p><h3><span>Personal Injury Settlement Breakdown</span></h3><p><span>Common</span><a href=\"http://www.findlaw.com/injury/accident-injury-law/injury-damages.html\"> <span>personal injury cases</span></a><span> include workplace accidents, motor vehicle accidents, medical malpractice, wrongful death, premises liability, and product liability. If you suffered a personal injury and you think somebody else may have been at fault, you might be eligible for compensation that can assist you in recouping the expenses you&apos;ve incurred as a result of your injury. If your loved one was injured or killed as a result of any of the above, you - as their next of kin - may be eligible for compensation. The only way to know for sure is to reach out to a personal injury attorney to explore the possibility of filing a bodily injury claim.</span></p><h3><span>Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.</span></h3><p><span>Are you struggling to make ends meet after a personal injury or did you lose a loved one due to an injury or accident?

  blog: '<p><span>When dealing with vehicle insurance, many people don’t really understand the provisions for uninsured and underinsured motorist coverage. These are additions to the standard vehicle insurance policy, but it is often rejected because the coverage may be a little confusing. Once someone understands</span><a href=\"https://www.investopedia.com/terms/u/underinsured-motorist-coverage.asp\"> <span>what is underinsured motorist coverage</span></a><span>, they can be better poised to make the decision about whether it will be advantageous for them to have it. There are distinct differences between underinsured and uninsured motorist coverage. Uninsured provides protection in an accident and the driver at fault doesn’t have liability insurance. Underinsured motorist coverage provides assistance if the at-fault driver doesn’t have enough liability insurance to cover medical expenses.</span></p><h3><span>What Is Underinsured Motorist Coverage</span></h3><p><span>If you’re wondering</span><a href=\"https://www.nerdwallet.com/article/insurance/underinsured-motorist-coverage\"> <span>how does underinsured motorist coverage work,</span></a><span> it’s the part of the policy that will cover your damages if the other party is responsible and does not have adequate insurance. This insurance is also starting to be required in certain states, so it’s always a good idea to check with your insurance agent before attempting to reject it from your policy. There are two types of coverage under this umbrella: motorist bodily injury, and motorist property damage. It is not uncommon for drivers to not have this provision. If you carry this type of insurance, it works well because your bills will be paid after the accident, especially if you’re fighting to recoup your losses. After all, who wants to be in an accident they didn’t cause and can’t’ get everything fixed or medical bills attended to?</span></p><h3><span>Underinsured and Uninsured Motorist Coverage</span></h3><p><span>If you’re wondering</span><a href=\"https://www.allstate.com/tr/car-insurance/uninsured-motorist-coverage.aspx\"> <span>do I need uninsured motorist coverage</span></a><span>, check with your agent. Uninsured and underinsured coverage protects you from those motorists that do not have liability coverage. This really comes in handy if you are in a car accident with someone who does not have enough insurance to cover your costs. If you find yourself in an accident, knowing what to expect can give you peace of mind. Having an</span><a href=\"auto-checklist\"> <span>auto checklist</span></a><span> on hand that can give you a general idea of what to do when involved in an accident is key.</span></p><h3><span>Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.&nbsp;</span></h3><p><span>If you find yourself in a situation where you are dealing with a driver that does not have uninsured motorist or underinsured motorist coverage, one of the first things you should do is</span><a href=\"hiring-a-lawyer\"> <span>contact a personal injury attorney.</span></a><span> While many people don’t understand what a personal injury attorney really does</span><a href=\"the-basics-of-personal-injury-what-does-personal-injury-include/\"><span>, learning the basics</span></a><span> can give you peace of mind when faced with certain situations, like vehicle accidents that result in medical expenses.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The team at Wallace & Graham is ready and able to walk you through the process of dealing with a case where the person doesn’t have adequate insurance. Don’t put yourself through the headache – let an experienced attorney handle things for you. Our attorneys can provide some perspective in having underinsured and uninsured motorist coverage.

You might be wondering what happens if the person at fault in an accident has no insurance, how you&apos;ll pay for medical bills and lost wages, or who will cover the cost to repair or replace your vehicle. These questions and concerns are normal and expected, and we&apos;re here to help. In this blog post, we&apos;ll share what you need to know in the event you ever face this unfortunate circumstance - including how to prepare ahead of time, what to do right after the accident if you&apos;re able, and who to contact for help during the aftermath.</span></p><h3><span>North Carolina Uninsured Motorist Statute</span></h3><p><span>If you&apos;re involved in an accident without insurance in North Carolina, there are several things to consider:</span></p><ol><li><span>First, your own Uninsured Motorist Coverage or Underinsured Motorist Coverage will help cover the cost of any injuries sustained in the accident. Reach out to your insurance carrier for help submitting claims and navigating that process. If the other driver was insured but the coverage doesn&apos;t cover the cost of medical treatment for all passengers, Underinsured Motorist Coverage can help fill the gap.</span></li><li><span>If you have collision coverage on your own policy and the other driver was uninsured, your collision coverage will likely cover the cost of damages your vehicle sustained in the accident.</span></li><li><span>Finally, you can sue the</span><a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/the-other-driver-doesnt-have-car-insurance-now-what.html\"> <span>uninsured driver</span></a><span> for any damages not covered by other means, although collecting any judgment awarded can be challenging if assets are limited.</span></li></ol><h3><span>Uninsured Motorist Coverage North Carolina</span></h3><p><span>If you live in North Carolina,</span><a href=\"https://www.natlawreview.com/article/hit-uninsured-motorist-what-you-should-know\"> <span>uninsured motorist coverage</span></a><span> can help you prevent the unexpected costs associated with a serious injury accident with an uninsured motorist. This additional coverage ensures that if you&apos;re involved in a motor vehicle accident with an uninsured driver, bodily injuries that occur to your passengers are covered by your insurance carrier.

  blog: '<p><span><strong>Celebrating 40 Years Of PracticeBy: Mona Lisa Wallace</strong>Did you know that last year Wallace & Graham celebrated its 40</span><span>th</span><span> year of business?&nbsp; Perhaps no one is more surprised than me.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In 1981, I decided to open my own law firm against all odds:&nbsp; a </span><i><span>female</span></i><span> attorney, a </span><i><span>female </span></i><span>business owner, a </span><i><span>female </span></i><span>boss, who was in her 20s, in the early 1980s, in a small town, in the South.&nbsp; I knew that I had passion and fight.&nbsp; I knew how much I cared about helping people.&nbsp; I knew my work ethic would carry me through the toughest of times.&nbsp; I could have never predicted that 40 years later, I would be joined by 60 incredible attorneys and legal professionals, joined for 30 years by the same steadfast and brilliant business partner, Bill Graham, and for 14 years by my equally passionate daughter, Whitney Wallace Williams, and that our talented team would be holding some of the most powerful corporations in the world accountable for legal wrongdoings.</span><span>The David versus Goliath challenges began almost at the beginning. As early as 1982, our firm took up the fight to provide a safe working environment for workers.&nbsp; By 1983, I began representing workers exposed to asbestos and chemicals, new litigation for the industry.&nbsp; Our team has worked tirelessly for decades to achieve unique success in representing injured workers harmed by dangerous exposures.&nbsp; We have represented thousands of workers exposed to asbestos and dangerous chemicals, as well as thousands injured on the job.&nbsp; We demanded employers implement their own programs of medical monitoring.&nbsp; We help exposed clients with early detection and cancer screenings.&nbsp; In one year alone, our firm’s efforts resulted in the early detection of over 100 cancers, saving lives as a result.&nbsp;</span>W&G attorneys, the late Mike Pross and Ed Pauley, devoted over 20 years to representing those injured by occupational diseases, influencing the law in the field.<span>Last year, my partner, Bill Graham, secured one of the largest verdicts in North Carolina history ($32.5 million) to help the family of a worker lost to mesothelioma, a rare cancer caused by asbestos exposure. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This work is something we are deeply proud of. &nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In addition to helping injured workers, the addition of the exceptionally talented attorney John Hughes to our firm in 2004, has enabled us to advance our civil department, taking on some of the largest corporate actors in consumer protection class actions and mass environmental actions in North Carolina history.&nbsp; We have represented countless victims of automobile accidents and corporate harm and countless families of those who lost a loved one due to the negligence of another, always going the extra mile to make sure all clients receive the maximum compensation possible for their injuries and harm.&nbsp; Over the years, as we have witnessed fraud, corporate unaccountability, discrimination, and greed, we have fought against it at every turn, achieving justice and securing some of the largest class action settlements and verdicts in the country.</span></p><p><span>In the last seven years, our biggest challenge has been our extended litigation battle against Smithfield Foods.&nbsp; Briefly, the facts are: Smithfield hires farmers to grow their hogs for them, dictating that the daily waste disposal method to dispose of thousands of hogs’ urine and feces is to pump the waste out of the barns into </span><i><span>multi-acre</span></i><span> open-air “lagoon” ponds full of waste.&nbsp; To prevent the waste ponds from overflowing, the waste is launched into the air with an industrial sprayer to “fertilize” surrounding fields next to our client&apos;s homes.&nbsp; Hog feces was detected in and on our clients’ houses and cars.&nbsp; Plumes of horrific feces odor could hit our clients’ homes at any unpredictable time, and there was nothing our clients could do about it.&nbsp; Our clients lost the use and enjoyment of their homes.&nbsp; Their basic property rights were assaulted.&nbsp; Many families – mostly African American - had inherited their land from ancestors dating back to Reconstruction, and nearly all the clients we helped were there </span><i><span>before</span></i><span> these operations moved in beside them.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our firm underwent five federal jury trials against the largest hog producer in the world – Smithfield Foods – a Chinese-owned corporation.&nbsp; Despite massive publicity campaigns that distorted our fight and rallied the farm community against our cause and lawsuits, the verdicts came back in favor of our clients each time.&nbsp; 5 straight wins.&nbsp;&nbsp; The third verdict for 10 clients was $473 million, believed to be the largest verdict in N.C. history. &nbsp;The surprise twists and turns of our litigation, and the seemingly insurmountable odds we faced, were so unbelievable that our fight will soon be featured in a book, to be released in June 2022, by renowned author, Corban Addison, with a foreword by John Grisham, who stated:&nbsp;</span></p><p><i><span>Wastelands</span></i><i><span> . . . is the uplifting, round-by-round true story of a bunch of rural plaintiffs with no money and seemingly little hope, and the lawyers who smelled injustice and went to war on their behalf. . . . Never in my most creative moments could I have assembled such a colorful cast of characters, and then blessed them with so riveting a set of facts, and then guided them through the ins and outs and uncertainties of high-stakes litigation.&nbsp; Beautifully written, impeccably researched, and told with an air of suspense that few writers can handle, </span></i><i><span>Wastelands</span></i><i><span> is a story I wish I had written.</span></i></p><p><span>As a result of these trials, positive changes have been made by Smithfield, yet many more need to be made for the people in Eastern North Carolina to breathe clean air and drink clean water.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Countless important cases, against so many tremendous odds, have been handled to success by our firm.&nbsp; Suits against predatory lenders.&nbsp; Suits against car dealerships who cheated consumers.&nbsp; Suits against companies who denied employees vested pension benefits. Suits against companies with deceptive business practices. Suits against corporations who put profit over people.&nbsp; Suits against companies that defrauded the government. Suits against nursing homes who run their facility to the detriment of the elderly’s safety and health.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Currently, our law firm is devoted to exposing and inciting change in the health care billing industry.&nbsp;&nbsp; North Carolina has the highest drug and hospital prices of almost any other State.&nbsp; We have filed two lawsuits against large hospital chains alleging deceptive and unfair health care pricing, including an 87 page lawsuit against the country’s largest hospital chain, HCA.&nbsp; If we can effect change and promote across-the-board transparency and fairness in health care costs on a statewide or national basis, it may be the pinnacle of my career.</span></p><p><span>Our list of fights and cases changes weekly as we see the more unfair and unjust treatment of our clients and workers throughout the country.&nbsp; The cases I mentioned are just a few of thousands that we have taken on, and are committed to taking on, to force change for the better in our world.</span></p><p><span>Why do we work so hard?&nbsp; Why do we sometimes put the demands of our work over our own needs and even sometimes, ashamedly, over the needs of our own family?&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Well, it’s because of you.&nbsp; Our clients.&nbsp; You are the heart of this firm.&nbsp; It is because of you that we wake up every morning and go to work, waiting on the next challenge we can face to make your lives better.&nbsp;&nbsp;You are the reason we love what we do.&nbsp; Your support and trust in us keep a fiery passion burning throughout our firm.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>This 40-year journey has been a long one; there’s no denying that.&nbsp; But our daily interactions with our beloved clients are what keep us moving forward.&nbsp; I cannot express to you the joy myself and my team feels when we are able to win big for our clients. For that, I have to thank each and every one of you. Thank you for believing in us and trusting us with some of your most important matters.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>From the family, at Wallace and Graham, I would like to extend our most heartfelt thanks for you, and cheers to another forty years!</span></p><p><span>Sincerely yours,<img src=clientuploads/Blog_Images/MonaWallaceSig.png\" alt=\"signature" style=\"max-width: 250px;\"></span></p>'

  blog: '<p><span>To Whom This May Concern,</span></p><p><span>I, Haley Ramsey, RN, am officially giving my 2-week notice of resignation to the Mother-Baby Unit of Mission Health.</span></p><p><span>After spending 20 years of my life dedicated to the Mission Mother-Baby unit, I have come to the sad conclusion that this chapter of my life must end. I have prayed and sought out wise counsel from family, friends, and coworkers whom I love and trust. This has not been an easy decision for me as I know it will impact a lot of people whom I care about. I would like to share some background as to why I have made this decision. I apologize for the length.</span></p><p><span>I was hired onto the Mother-Baby Unit in June 2000 as a CNA during the last year of my nursing education. I was thrilled to have been hired and be an employee of Mission Hospital. It was once something to be proud of, and I was. My role consisted of many different tasks. I helped our nurses keep our unit organized and well-stocked. I was able to learn and help with tasks at the front desk such as answering phones, answering call bells, and breaking down charts. This is no easy task. Kudos to our extremely hard-working and multitasking unit secretaries. We couldn&apos;t make it without you! I was blessed with the opportunity to help with patients as well. The most exciting part for me was being able to help give baths and do hearing tests on our very newest and tiny patients, the babies. I gained an immense amount of knowledge and skills during that time. The nurses took me under their wings and exposed me to as many situations as they could while encouraging my learning during those last months of nursing school.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I was honored to take a registered nurse position back on my home unit, Mother-Baby in June of 2001. Within 6 months of being hired as a registered nurse on Mother Baby, I was being asked to take on the role of relief charge nurse and preceptor to other new employees of our unit. I felt honored to be entrusted with the care of our unit. I took my role seriously and wanted to be the best teacher and leader I could when placed in these roles.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Mission Hospital was once such a beacon for our community. I remember how involved the staff was in volunteer work and fundraising for the March of Dimes. I remember the days when they had big events like The Ducky Derby held at the Asheville Malls supporting our NICU babies. I remember having bake sales and volunteer days at local community outreach centers such as the Manna Food Bank. The hospital held special appreciation lunch events for the staff that were quite lovely with food, music, and token appreciation gifts. My co-workers and I truly felt cared for by the hospital management and the community. We were a community.</span></p><p><span>I am someone who takes pride in the cleanliness of my space whether that be at home or at work. I was always so impressed with how clean and nice our hospital was. We were blessed to have the equipment replaced when needed and in a timely manner. The rooms, hallways, nursing stations, and lounge areas were always comfortable and clean. I gave birth to each of my children at Mission and never had to worry about the cleanliness of any of my rooms. I knew that the hospital was always aiming to better itself. We were able to confidently give good care, in a clean, and comfortable environment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I was proud to be an employee of Mission Hospital, and knew that when I needed to take some time away to be with my third child, as my husband and I adjusted to being outnumbered, that I would be able to return with open arms to my second home, the Mother-Baby Unit. I returned in February of 2007. It was hard to be away from my family at home, but good to be back with an amazing work family that supported me through the transition. I quickly jumped right back in and was able to use the gifts that God has blessed me with as I cared for our new mamas and babies of WNC.</span></p><p><span>I can&apos;t deny that society has been changing, the economy has been changing, politics are changing and therefore healthcare is changing. Mission has not been able to escape this. I know that medical professionals all over the country have experienced this over the past several years, but to experience a nonprofit hospital being taken over by an enormous money-making corporation has been devastating.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Mission Health was previously a nonprofit community hospital. Today it is a for-profit hospital making the HCA corporation a lot of money. How does a business make money one might ask? Well, you cut costs at the bottom so you have more profit at the top. I learned this very simple concept in a business class that I took a few years ago as my husband and I started our own small business. HCA is doing this very thing, and to an extreme. This corporation has employees literally making 10&apos;s of millions of dollars a year, while the employees that do the actual physical and mental work caring for patients are experiencing cuts like never before. The nursing staff was promised at the very beginning of this take over that our nurse-to-patient ratios would not change. That remained true for only about 3 months.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>HCA started by taking our support staff. Our unit secretaries were removed from the units and we were told that they were being helped to find new jobs. Our CNA&apos;s were either moved to other areas of the hospital, let go or placed in the secretary position so they could now take on both the role of the secretary and nursing assistant. For our Mother-Baby Unit that meant we took one person off of the floor that played a vital role in giving smooth and timely care to our patients. Our unit requires having a secretary at the desk at all times as their role is a very busy one. Letting patients and visitors in and out of our locked unit, answering phone calls, answering call bells for 34 rooms, making charts for all of our new patients, breaking down charts for all of our discharged patients, retrieving items from our tube system, making sure the right nurse receives the items sent, sending off important lab work to the state, entering information into our computer system, and answering the questions of countless people approaching the front desk as the secretary is the first smiling face you see as you enter our unit. These are just some of the extremely important tasks our secretaries are responsible for. So unfortunately now, our CNA&apos;s can no longer do the many important and time-consuming tasks they previously helped with on our unit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Our CNA’s helped us bathe our tiny newborn patients, draw labs, and helped watch them when a mother or family member was unable to. They helped mothers to the restroom, set up rooms for new patients, stocked the unit with necessary equipment, they wheeled patients out to their cars at the time of discharge, and helped with many other tasks. Not having their vital support has definitely added strain to the workload of our nurses.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>In May of 2019, I noticed that our staffing grid had changed. I am frequently placed in the relief charge nurse position, so I am responsible for making the assignments on days that I am in this role. The grid decreased the number of nursing staff allowed for the number of patients on the unit. Staffing has been made into a numbers game. Unfortunately, assigning nurses to care for patients is not something that can simply be determined by the number of patients you have. Patients have unique care needs and their acuity must be taken into consideration as you determine the number of nurses needed to safely care for the unit. Our core staffing numbers decreased, so keep in mind that we don&apos;t even schedule enough nurses to adequately staff our unit when we are full. We used to care for no more than 6 patients at a time. In recent days our nurses are caring for as many as 10 patients at a time. This is absolutely unsafe and has led to our nurses and unit staff feeling burnt out and defeated. We are taking on heavier patient loads, have less support staff, and have new tasks regularly being added to our list of things to do. So, as you would probably expect, our nurses are tired and don’t want to work at Mission anymore. Nurses are quitting, and we have fewer and fewer nurses to staff our unit. The Mother-Baby Unit has experienced a loss of over 18 nurses in a span of about 6 months.</span></p><p><span>Not only is the nursing staff suffering. It appears the ancillary staff throughout the hospital are suffering as well. The hospital has never been as filthy and unkempt as it is now. Trash runs over and onto the floors in the patient rooms, nurses&apos; stations, and lounges. Hazardous materials disposal containers have IV fluid bags and tubing pouring out into the medication room floor. Laundry bags pile up and run over onto the floors of our soiled utility rooms. Meal trays are constantly left behind in the patient rooms. Sinks and toilets aren&apos;t being kept clean, and most concerning leftover items from previous patients are being left in "clean" rooms and baby bassinets. So, why is this? Every time I ask what is going on I receive the same response "We are short staffed. We are doing the best we can." I know this is true and very unfortunate. Yet again, guess who gets to pick up the slack and take out the trays, empty the trash, and reclean the baby bassinets? The already overstretched and overly stressed nursing staff try to make sure that our patients don&apos;t directly feel the impact of this disaster, and we do it ourselves.</span></p><p><span>The nursing staff was approached by the Union shortly after HCA bought Mission Hospitals. Obviously, the nurses were seeking an answer, some support, or a way to turn things back around. I personally have felt skeptical about joining the union, because I felt it would take away from my being able to speak for myself and to have a direct relationship with my manager, whom I respect. I did not vote for the Union even though I knew there was a major need for change. I was hopeful that this could happen without such chaos and division. Regardless of my feelings, the nursing staff of Mission Health voted in the Union. The contract that has been agreed upon between HCA and the Union did not pan out well for some of the PRN staff that have dedicated many years to Mission.</span></p><p><span>Approximately 4 weeks ago I was contacted by my manager who gave me some bad news. She informed me that the PRN payment model was being changed and I needed to make a decision about which of the new tiers I wanted to commit to. I was told that a decision was needed that day. I do want to say that my manager did approach me with compassion and care about the situation. This did seem to be out of her hands. She gave me the facts that were available, but it was very difficult for me to understand as I had so many questions, and there were so few answers available.&nbsp; It was a lose-lose situation for me. None of the new tier levels came close to reaching my base pay rate let alone my previous incentive pay of 20%. My best case scenario was a loss of 20% and my worst case scenario was a loss of 32% of my wages. Over a three-week period of time, I was approached 3 times with different information and was asked to make a decision over the phone about what tier I wanted to commit to. The second conversation was brought to me as good news and they found a way for PRN staff to be able to keep our pay. I was first informed that if I became a tier 1 PRN employee I would be able to keep my current pay rate. The following week I was contacted by my supervisor and told that I would actually have to commit to a tier 2 to keep my current rate. The new tier model does not equally reflect the hours and commitment to the previous percentage model. I was also informed that if I chose a lower tier that I would be taken back to the new PRN tier payment model losing my 20% and my previous base pay. If this all sounds confusing it&apos;s because it is confusing. Ultimately, the new tier 2 is a greater commitment than the previous commitment that I had made to receive the 20% incentive. I am unable and unwilling to commit to the new Tier 2. I also find it insulting that a new graduate and a nurse with 20 years experience are placed under the same payment model. We would be making the same wage. This is a win for the new graduate, but a devastating loss to me, a nurse, who has dedicated her whole adult life, and experience to one unit.</span></p><p><span>I understand and accept that my not being willing to commit to this new model will cause me to lose my previous 20% incentive. However, I do not accept nor do I understand the hospital being able to take away from the base pay that I have earned over the past 14+ years. I called and spoke to Mother-Baby Unit&apos;s human resources representative and her supervisor. They confirmed the information that was given to me by my supervisor and manager. I questioned how they could take away from my base pay rate as this consists of my cost of living raises and 3 MERIT raises that I had earned over the past 14 years. The response I received is that "this is a new model." I asked our representative why this was&nbsp; happening and was informed that because of the new union contract "the money had to come from somewhere." I tearfully responded " so, I am being punished for a contract that I didn&apos;t even vote for?" and the human resource supervisor responded back to me "in theory, yes."</span></p><p><span>My pay rate has already been cut by 30.01% per my Lawson pay rate history as of July 17, 2021. This rate change occurred in the middle of a schedule that I signed up for while making my previous rate. The new commitment that I made to the hospital only requires me to sign up for 1 day every 60 days. I have worked 4 shifts since my pay rate was changed and have more than fulfilled my new commitment. I do not believe that I should be held accountable for the shifts that were committed to under a different agreement. I am especially upset about this because the hospital is offering any staff that works extra shifts an incentive of an extra $30/hr over their base pay rate. This includes housekeeping, dietary, and to my understanding anyone working in the patient care areas. I am making less money than any staff member receiving that incentive. I have been told that I am not eligible for this incentive as I am already on the schedule. I have asked for clarification and help with this matter and received no response. My last attempt was a phone call to the human resource supervisor on Thursday, August 12, 2021. I left a detailed message with my concerns and have not been contacted back.</span></p><p><span>I am a real person. I am a wife, a mama of 7, a soon-to-be grandmother, a friend, and I have been a loyal employee and nurse of Mission Health&apos;s Mother-Baby Unit for 20 of my 41 years of life. I was one of three nurses from Mission Hospitals that was honored as one of the Great 100 Nurses of NC in 2020.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>I have never been so disrespected or unappreciated in all of my working career as I have been in the past month. I am no longer willing to put my license, my reputation, or my physical and mental health on the line for a company that does not care about it&apos;s employees or the community it claims to serve.</span></p><p><span>I am truly sad to be leaving my unit. I know my fellow coworkers and work-family are hurting as they work through the most trying times we have ever experienced. To each of you, I am so very sorry.</span></p><p><span>I am praying for all of the staff of Mission Health. I am also praying for the community served by Mission Health. HCA is not who we are.</span></p><p><span>Sincerely,</span></p><p><span>Haley Ramsey RN</span></p>'

  blog: '<p>If you were hurt at work, you should file a workers’ compensation claim. However, how do you know if you even have a case? What if your worker&apos;s comp case is denied? Do I have a personal injury claim instead? What if I don’t like the worker&apos;s comp judge decision? All of these are important questions that you should ask yourself prior to filing an <a href=\"injured-at-work\" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/injured-at-work\">NC workers comp claim</a>.</p><h3>Determining Whether You Have a Case</h3><p>If you were hurt on the job, the first thing you should do is get medical attention. Everything else can come after that. That also gives you time to document what happened, as you will need to provide a statement of your injuries to the workers’ compensation board or your worker&apos;s compensation attorney. Writing down your statement helps you remember everything that happened, and you have a couple of days to do this.</p><p>In a nutshell, if you have a personal injury claim, someone is at fault for your injuries. With a <a href=\"how-does-worker-s-compensation-work/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/how-does-worker-s-compensation-work/\">workers’ comp claim</a>, you do not have to show fault – you just need to show that you were injured on the job. Even if you were injured through your own negligence, you could apply for workers’ compensation.</p><p>If you believe you have a <a href=\"https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/workers-compensation/difference-personal-injury-claim.html" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/workers-compensation/difference-personal-injury-claim.html\">personal injury case</a>, you have to prove someone was at fault for the accident. For example, if you slip and fall on a dry walkway that is in excellent condition on your way from one building to another, no one is at fault for the accident. If the same walkway, which is a high travel area for employees, is iced over or is uneven, you might prove that your employer was at fault for the accident because it did not maintain the walkway.</p><h3>Workers Comp Denied Claim</h3><p>If you believe you are entitled to a <a href=\"four-types-of-workers-compensation-benefits-and-how-they-are-paid/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/four-types-of-workers-compensation-benefits-and-how-they-are-paid/\">workers comp settlement</a>, but your claim is denied, or you believe that the settlement is not a fair settlement, even when based on the worker&apos;s comp settlement chart, you have alternative options.</p><h3>When Will Workers Comp Offer a Settlement?</h3><p>Your employer’s workers’ compensation insurance will only <a href=\"do-you-get-a-settlement-from-workers-compensation/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/do-you-get-a-settlement-from-workers-compensation/\">offer a settlement</a> if you can show that you were injured at work and if your injuries prevent you from working. The insurance company could award a settlement but can also take it away if they find out that you are not really hurt.</p><p>To prevent this from happening, always seek medical attention immediately after an incident, make sure you keep follow-up appointments, and follow your doctor’s orders.</p><h3>What if I Don’t Agree with the Workers’ Comp Judge Decision?</h3><p>If you do not believe that the <a href=\"https://www.embroker.com/blog/workers-comp-settlement/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.embroker.com/blog/workers-comp-settlement/\">workers’ compensation judge made a fair decision</a>, you can retain a workers’ compensation attorney to help you appeal the decision. You also have the option to file a lawsuit against your employer and/or its workers’ compensation insurance.</p><p>People often try to get a settlement first since the courts could rule that you should get less than what a court might order. However, if you have injuries that are expected to turn into <a href=\"https://www.halt.org/get-what-youre-due-10-serious-signs-you-need-a-workers-comp-attorney/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.halt.org/get-what-youre-due-10-serious-signs-you-need-a-workers-comp-attorney/\">long-term or permanent disabilities</a> and the workers’ comp insurance refuses to settle for enough compensation to cover them, you can attempt to litigate your claim.</p><h3>When I Should Hire a Workers’ Comp Attorney</h3><p>Many people try to settle their workers’ compensation claims during the first phase themselves. However, an NC workers’ comp attorney can help you through that claim and will already have the facts ready if you should have to <a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-to-expect-at-your-workers-compensation-hearing.html" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/what-to-expect-at-your-workers-compensation-hearing.html\">file an appeal or litigate your claim</a>.

  blog: '<p>After suffering injuries in an accident, you should consider retaining a personal injury attorney. Many people attempt to settle claims themselves but find that they do not receive a fair settlement from the defendant. Immediately after you are injured, seek medical attention, then, as soon as possible contact a personal injury attorney.</p><h3>What to Expect When Meeting Your Lawyer</h3><p>When meeting with your lawyer for the first time, expect to discuss your case in detail. At first, your lawyer will be asking the questions, but you should also have questions. Before your appointment, write down <a href=\"questions-to-ask" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/questions-to-ask\">questions to ask your lawyer during a consultation</a>. The answers to the questions open up a two-way conversation that helps you determine whether your personalities will get along or clash.</p><p>You can also determine if your lawyer is qualified to handle your case. Not all personal injury lawyers are familiar with all areas of personal injury. For example, not all personal injury lawyers handle wage and hour discrimination cases. You’ll want an <a href=\"how-to-choose-a-personal-injury-lawyer" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/how-to-choose-a-personal-injury-lawyer\">attorney who is very familiar</a> with those laws, not one who is just starting out.</p><h3>What to Bring When Meeting Your Lawyer</h3><p>You should bring any relevant documents and a notebook to take notes. If you were served with a lawsuit, be sure to review the lawsuit carefully, and bring it with you. If you have a way to make copies, make yourself a copy – you’ll need to give the original to the attorney.</p><p>Other items you should bring:</p><ul class="list"><li><p>If your attorney gave you an initial consultation sheet to fill out, fill it out to the best of your abilities and bring it with you. Make sure your writing is neat and legible. The initial consultation sheet is often used to prepare the basis for a lawsuit or settlement negotiations if it has questions about the incident.</p></li><li><p>If you have any evidence, such as a police report from a car accident, or any medical records, bring those with you.</p></li><li><p>If you are meeting a personal injury lawyer, you <a href=\"https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/what-to-expect-when-meeting-your-attorney-for-the-first-time-35139" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/what-to-expect-when-meeting-your-attorney-for-the-first-time-35139\">don’t need to worry about payment</a>. The initial consultation is free, and most personal injury lawyers, including Wallace & Graham, represent you on a contingency basis – that means the lawyer doesn’t get paid unless you win.</p></li><li><p>An outline of the facts of the case. This will help ensure that you don’t forget to discuss any important points, and will also help you answer the questions your lawyer will have for you. An outline also helps you fill out the initial consultation sheet.</p></li></ul><h3>What to Wear When Meeting Your Lawyer</h3><p>Always wear respectable clothing when meeting your lawyer. You should dress as if you were going to appear in court or as if you were going to work in an office. If all you have is jeans, they are fine as long as they are not stained (some jobs stain every piece of clothing you have), a nice top, and appropriate shoes. Even sneakers are fine, as long as they are clean.</p><p>Your lawyer will want to know if you can represent yourself appropriately should you have to go to court. The manner in which you dress goes a long way toward showing your credibility, especially in a courtroom.</p><h3>The Initial Consultation</h3><p>Always get everything ready the day before the <a href=\"https://www.utahbar.org/public-services/meeting-your-lawyer/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.utahbar.org/public-services/meeting-your-lawyer/\">consultation</a>. Leave 15 or 20 minutes early. If you are late, not only do you throw the attorney’s schedule off, but it could cause you to have less time with the attorney if he or she must leave the office for a court appointment, depositions, arbitration, or another meeting with third parties.</p><p>When you get to the office, you’ll have a few minutes to read over your notes to add anything you thought of after you initially made your notes, and refresh your memory of the points you need to discuss.</p><p>Contact a personal injury lawyer at <a href=\"contact-us" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/contact-us\">Wallace & Graham</a> as soon after an accident as possible. Even if you are still in the hospital, you should contact your attorney. If you want too long, you could run out of time to attempt a settlement prior to having to file a lawsuit, and you could forget some of the facts that are pertinent in representing you to the best of the attorney’s ability.</p>'

  blog: '<p>When a product injures someone, the Consumer Product Safety Commission recommends that the company recall the dangerous product. However, in this case, Peloton refused to recall their Tread+ treadmill after dozens of children suffered injuries and one six-year-old child died from injuries after being sucked under the track.</p><p>The company eventually agreed that it should recall the Tread+ and its other treadmill, the Peloton Tread treadmill. However, the Peloton Tread was not the subject of the recall because of the track – that one was recalled because the touchscreen could fall off.</p><h3>The Peloton Recall for the Tread+</h3><p>The Tread+ with a model number of TR01 features a 67-inch running deck space with a 32-inch high-definition touchscreen. The belt is a slatted belt instead of the one-piece belt found on most treadmills. The Peloton Tread has a one-piece belt and, thus far, has not posed a danger to users, children or pets.</p><p>If you have the Peloton Tread+ with model number TR01, the company recommends that you stop using it and contact it for a full refund. You have until Nov. 6, 2022, to get a full refund. If you submit your claim after that date, you will get a partial refund. Your other option is to accept Peloton&apos;s offer of having someone move the treadmill to a room where children and pets do not have access. The peloton will provide this service for free.</p><h3>Treadmill Injuries Leading to the Recall</h3><p>According to the recall information, Peloton received 72 reports of children, pets, and adults being pulled under the rear of the treadmill. Those reports include 29 reports of injuries to children. The children suffered broken bones, lacerations, and second-and third-degree abrasions.</p><p>The unit was sold between Sept. 2018 and Apr. 2021 at Peloton showrooms and onepeloton.com.</p><h3>Recoverable Damages</h3><p>Those injured or who lost a loved one in product liability cases can recover damages. Depending on your circumstances, you could recover economic damages, including lost wages, medical expenses, and funeral, burial, and/or cremation expenses. Depending on the severity of your injuries, you might recover non-economic damages. If you lost a loved one, you could also recover economic and non-economic damages.</p><p>Injuries could include abrasions, broken bones, face, and eye injuries, amputation of a digit or limb, or death. If doctors expect any of these injuries to cause long-term or permanent disabilities, you could also recover future medical expenses and lost wages.</p><p>While the money does not bring back a loved one, it does reduce the financial stress of having less income coming into the household. Non-economic damages include:</p><ul class="list"><li>Pain and suffering, including emotional distress.</li><li>Loss of companionship and/or consortium.</li><li>Loss of quality of life.</li><li>Loss of use of a body part or bodily function.</li><li>Inconvenience.</li></ul><p>If you also suffer from anxiety or depression because the Peloton Tread+ caused injuries or death to a child or a pet, you could recover medical expenses for the costs of cognitive and/or other psychological therapies. You can also recover expenses for physical therapy and occupational therapy if your injuries caused extensive damage that requires one or both types of therapy.</p><p>If you or a loved one suffered injuries, or you lost a loved one because of the Peloton Tread+, contact Wallace & Graham for a free case evaluation.</p>'

Bayer inherited the business and the litigation as part of a $63 billion acquisition of Monsanto in 2018.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">The company has said that decades of studies have shown Roundup and glyphosate are safe for human use.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Wednesday’s settlement would cover future claims brought by individuals who have been diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and were exposed to Roundup before their diagnosis. The settlement also includes benefits for people who were exposed to Roundup and develop the cancer in the future.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Roundup, which Monsanto first brought to the market in 1974, is widely used by farmers across the United States and Brazil, alongside crops that are genetically engineered to withstand the its herbicidal effect.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Glyphosate will remain on the market. Bayer agreed to seek permission from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency to provide a reference link on labels so consumers can find scientific studies on the weedkiller.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Under the proposed plan, Bayer will provide $2 billion for a four-year period as compensation and to cover outreach and diagnostic assistance. Future claimants could receive up to $200,000 under the deal.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">The parties can agree to extend the settlement period.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">The company said the settlement amount was disclosed last year.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">The agreement must be approved by U.S. District Court Judge Vince Chhabria in San Francisco.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Chhabria in June questioned the legality of a prior settlement plan that Bayer proposed, which envisioned creating a panel of scientists who would rule on the viability of claims.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Under the revised deal, anyone who does not make a claim during the four-year period would then be able to sue in court, according Elizabeth Cabraser, an attorney for the proposed class. She also said anyone diagnosed with non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma who does not like their compensation offer under the class plan can go to the court system and try for a better result.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">In June, Bayer reached a wider $9.6 billion settlement that would resolve the bulk of the more than 100,000 U.S. lawsuits that were already filed over Roundup.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">Bayer’s stock has been battered by the litigation, but also by billions of euros in writedowns, and a bleaker profit outlook, in large part related to the $63 billion Monsanto takeover.</p><p class=\"Paragraph-paragraph-2Bgue ArticleBody-para-TD_9x\">The group last year announced 9.25 billion euros in impairment charges on agricultural assets and shocked markets by predicting a slight decline in core earnings per share in 2021 on weaker demand by farmers.</p>'

Regarding punitive damages, the Court recognized that the plaintiffs “provided evidence of [Murphy-Brown’s] deliberate corporate policies and evidence that [Murphy-Brown] knew these policies had associated harms.” There was “abundant evidence supporting [Murphy-Brown’s] conscious disregard of the conditions at Kinlaw Farms.” And Murphy-Brown’s “leadership persisted in mandating the culpable practices and participated in political efforts aimed at minimizing regulation of harms known to be associated with [MurphyBrown’s] chosen farming efforts.” The Court acknowledges that while there was ample evidence of Murphy-Brown’s willful misconduct justifying punitive damages, the district court should have limited the applicability of evidence regarding Smithfield’s financial status and remanded the case for new proceedings solely on the amount of punitive damages that should be awarded.</p><p>In his concurrence, Judge Wilkinson discussed how the hog farming industry is vital but required “responsible stewardship” to “account for [the] full impact on all stakeholders.” “Stakeholders do not just include consumers, suppliers, and employees; they include neighbors of hog facilities, children who go to school nearby, medical patients who rely on antibiotics, wildlife and water sports enthusiasts, and many more.”</p><p>Lead appellate counsel, Tillman J. Breckenridge of Breckenridge PLLC stated that he was pleased that “the Court of Appeals recognized that the jury was right – Smithfield willfully and wantonly interfered with our clients’ ability to live comfortably in their own homes.” He added that the decision “vindicates the hard work of the trial team, as the Court rebuked Smithfield and MurphyBrown’s practices.” Mona Lisa Wallace added that “we are thrilled at the positive outcome for our clients and the environment. We are especially glad that the Fourth Circuit recognized that the North Carolina jury got it right.” Lisa Blue noted that “we had faith in the jury systems and in the wonderful jurors who dedicated many weeks to understanding the plight of these North Carolina citizens and we’re delighted to see the jurors’ thoughtful consideration and decisions upheld.” Lead trial lawyer, Mike Kaeske further added: “I’m honored to have represented the most worthy group of clients of my career, and I’m grateful that the Court has so fully recognized the truth of their struggle.”</p><p>For the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeal’s full opinion, click here:&nbsp;<span style=\"color: #0000ff;\"><a style=\"color: #0000ff;" href=\"https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/191019.P.pdf" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?q=https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/opinions/191019.P.pdf&source=gmail&ust=1605977499595000&usg=AFQjCNEyuFRdypvKRk0O-R-QSw4ZjT7TqA\">https://www.ca4.uscourts.gov/<wbr>opinions/191019.P.pdf</a></span></p>'

Military families’ pleas to Congress and governmental agencies resulted in the nonprofit MFAN (Military Family Advisory Network) releasing a report reflecting that over 67% of all Fort Bragg families surveyed reported manifest effects from maintenance, repairs, and mediation.&nbsp; Heads of the Corvias admitted to Congress in 2019, under oath, its responsibility for unacceptable conditions.&nbsp; The complaint requests retrospective relief for the harms suffered by military service members and their families.&nbsp; The complaint requests class action designation.</span></p><p><span>Our complaint details numerous defective housing conditions suffered by our clients, including but not limited to the following:</span></p><ul class=\"list\"><li><span>Issues with mold and wood rot;</span></li><li><span>The lack of effective moisture and air barriers between exterior cladding and wall cavities;</span></li><li><span>Complaints of water damage in children’s bedrooms;</span></li><li><span>Complaints of leaking from the top of the home through interior walls;</span></li><li><span>Evidence of roof rot;</span></li><li><span>Evidence of ant infestation;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>HVAC system failure;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Cracking in walls and ceilings;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Black mold and structural wood rot found following an odor in a child’s bedroom;</span></li><li><span>Lead-based paint which poses a threat to children;</span></li><li><span>Filthy carpets with nails sticking out from under it;</span></li><li><span>Nonfunctioning electrical sockets;</span></li><li><span>Numerous issues associated with plumbing and leaks;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Sagging roofs, resulting in roof collapse;</span></li><li><span>Sagging interior floors, due to water damage;</span></li><li><span>Window frames damp to the touch and rotted with visible mold;</span></li><li><span>Issues with dry wall being water-permeable and not moisture rated;</span></li><li><span>Observable light through door seals due to improper fitting, which allowed both water and bugs access into the home;</span></li><li><span>Roof leaks and soft ceilings;</span></li><li><span>Evidence of defective repairs and patches in response to complaints;</span></li><li><span>Mold and mildew resulted in permanent odors to clothing;</span></li><li><span>Layers of linoleum flooring, revealing each layer covered with hidden mold;</span></li><li><span>Heating element on a family’s dishwasher caught fire and smoked;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></li><li><span>Defective carbon monoxide detectors in units; and</span></li><li><span>A carbon monoxide leak resulting in physical harm to a military family, including severe fatigue, headaches, memory loss, congestion, gastrointestinal issues, and respiratory distress and harm to the child’s minor child resulting in severe headaches, runny nose, and “blue” inside of her nose.</span></li></ul><p><span>Our complaint alleges evidence of Corvias’ efforts to: conceal reported harmful environment and structural housing defects in all of the homes; direct shoddy repairs to cut costs; direct maintenance workers and vendors to conceal defects and not disclose defects to tenants; and direct the same not to use words such as “mold” around tenants.&nbsp; Corvias work orders disguised complaints and inaccurately downplayed reported and observed defects.&nbsp; Corvias asked residents to overlook defects on numerous occasions.&nbsp; In one disturbing example, when a family complained of lead paint and lead piping, Corvias advised the residents not to drink their tap water and not to let their toddler “eat paint chips.”&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Most tenants used the entirety of their housing allowance to afford the inadequate units, and many were forced to use low military salaries pay for their own repairs.</span></p><p><span>Our firm seeks a jury trial to address numerous issues including whether Corvias breached numerous housing statutes; concealed material facts and information about the units to residents; colluded and conspired to evade their repair and maintenance obligations by labeling housing defects as “wear and tear;” overcharged Plaintiffs for repair and maintenance items; used unfair and deceptive practices; and whether class members incurred substantial and unreasonable loss of use and enjoyment of their leaseholds of their homes, rising to the level of breach of the warranty of habitability, or, temporary recurrent private nuisance, for which they should be entitled to a refund reflecting the diminished rental value of the units during the class period as a result.</span></p><p></p>'

The firm’s clients had deep roots in their rural communities, only to have their lives changed when factory farms were built within feet of their homes.&nbsp; Smithfield directed farms to use a waste disposal system which consisted of hog urine and feces dropping beneath slats on the floors and tunneling into open-air lagoons which were up to three acres large.&nbsp; To prevent flooding of the lagoon, the waste was frequently sprayed into the air as a fertilizer. The lawsuit alleged neighbors suffered from things that no property owner should have to endure – horrible odor, clouds of flies, buzzards circling, trucks leaking filth and waking them up in the middle of the night, and children being teased for smelling like hogs. </span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Five separate three- to four-week trials took place in 2018 and 2019, with each eastern North Carolina jury unanimously returning verdicts in favor of the plaintiffs totaling more than $500 million, including the largest verdict in North Carolina history.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=\"p4\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The plaintiffs faced many obstacles along the way, including new legislation which would have effectively granted retroactive immunity to Smithfield from these suits, and organized hog rallies blocks from the courthouse steps.</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">Accepting the award on behalf of the firm, Mona Lisa Wallace emphasized the bravery of her clients to fight for change and the courage of the testifying witnesses and experts, such as Harnett County hog farmer Tom Butler who testified in each trial that there were economically feasible alternatives that eliminated the harm to nearby neighbors.&nbsp; </span></p><p class=\"p5\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\">The cases are currently on appeal at the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals in Richmond, Virginia, but the verdicts have already caused lasting, positive change in the industry.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p6\"><span class=\"s1\">&nbsp;</span></p>'

Schroeder, the Chief District Judge of the Middle District of North Carolina Federal Court, found that portions of North Carolina General Statute § 99A-2 were unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution.&nbsp;&nbsp; The case had been filed on January 13, 2016 and has drawn the attention and involvement of numerous interest groups.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">The underlying bill was passed over the veto of then-Governor Patrick McCrory by the North Carolina General Assembly on June 3, 2015.&nbsp; At that time, Dan Forest was the President of the N.C. Senate and Tim Moore was the Speaker of the House of Representatives.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">While then-Governor McCrory was generally a supporter of agricultural interests, even he felt the bill had gone too far.&nbsp; In his veto statement, Governor McCrory stated in part regarding the bill, “I believe it does not adequately protect or give clear guidance to honest employees who uncover criminal activity. I am concerned that subjecting these employees to potential civil penalties will create an environment that discourages them from reporting illegal activities.”<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">At the time the bill was passed, the Wallace and Graham law firm had been litigating its North Carolina Hog Farm Nuisance cases for two years.&nbsp; Those cases, originally brought in state court and then re-filed in federal court, allege that neighboring families of certain of the industrialized swine growing operations in the eastern part of the State have had to deal with obnoxious and unreasonable levels of foul odor, flies, heavy trucks, and other nuisances.&nbsp; The lawsuits also allege the communities pre-dated the industrialized hog operations.&nbsp; Five of those cases went to trial in the 2018 and 2019 time period.&nbsp; Since then, appeals have been filed, and the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals heard the oral argument of the first appeal in January 2020.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">At the time that the bill was passed, it was widely perceived as being an “Ag-Gag” bill meant to make it harder to report evidence of unlawful conditions inside of agricultural facilities.&nbsp; Free-speech advocates criticized the bill for seeking to impose on First Amendment rights.&nbsp; In the hog farm nuisance cases, the Plaintiffs had to file a motion with the Court simply to obtain access for their scientific experts to enter the facilities to make measurements and take samples.&nbsp; There was evidence that the swine operations had fences and “no trespassing” signs and that it was impossible for neighbors to actually see what the conditions were inside of the enclosed hog sheds, from outside the property line.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">While at the time of the bill’s passage it was widely viewed as an attempt to stifle attempts to investigate and report on industrialized animal growing operations, in fact the language of the bill itself went far beyond just the agricultural sector.&nbsp; The main part of the bill, enacted as North Carolina General Statutes Section 99A-2, did not seek to limit itself only to agricultural operations.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">Rather, the new law, enacted as Session Law 2015-50, stated broadly that “[a]ny person who intentionally gains access to the nonpublic areas of another&apos;s premises and engages in an act that exceeds the person&apos;s authority to enter those areas is liable to the owner or operator of the premises for any damages sustained.”&nbsp; N.C. Gen. Stat. § 99A-2.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">In the Court case, those challenging the scope of the bill included People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals, the Center for Food Safety, the Animal Legal Defense Fund, Farm Sanctuary, Food & Water Watch, the Government Accountability Project, Farm Forward, and the American Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">In addition, numerous First Amendment advocates and news media free-speech advocates joined in submitting briefs that supported those suing.&nbsp; These groups included the American Society of News Editors, The Associated Press Media Editors, Association of Alternative Newsmedia, Capitol Broadcasting Company, First Look Media Works, Forbes, Freedom of the Press Foundation, Gannett and many others.&nbsp; The prominent Law Professors, Erwin Chemerinsky and Jack Preis also filed a brief.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">The initial complaint was brought against Defendants the North Carolina Attorney General (charged generally with defending any new laws once they are in place), and the Chancellor of UNC-Chapel Hill.&nbsp; The reason why UNC was named was because one of the Plaintiffs, the PETA group, alleged that it had a specific concern with potential animal cruelty issues at UNC animal testing laboratories.&nbsp; The initial complaint also pointed to a prior investigation at a North Carolina hog farm that supplied Smithfield Foods.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">After the complaint was initially filed, the Defendants filed a motion that sought to dismiss the case on the grounds that it was too speculative to say that the animal-rights organizations who were suing would in fact be subjected to adverse action under the new law if they sought to investigate animal cruelty issues.&nbsp; Judge Schroeder granted the motion to dismiss in a 38-page Order that was filed on May 2, 2017.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">On June 5, 2018, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit reversed the decision.&nbsp; It found that the Plaintiffs had shown enough standing to be entitled to proceed further in Court.&nbsp; In its decision, the Fourth Circuit noted that the Plaintiffs were “alleging that the Act interferes with their plans to conduct undercover investigations of government facilities in North Carolina for the purpose of gathering evidence of unethical and illegal animal practices and to disseminate this information to the public, in violation of the First and Fourteenth Amendments to the United States Constitution and various provisions of the North Carolina Constitution.”<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">After the case returned before Judge Schroeder, there were multiple additional documents and briefs that were filed.&nbsp; The matter was orally argued in the Court on February 6, 2020.&nbsp; On June 12, 2020, the District Court issued its new, 73-page Order.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">The new Order is very detailed and specific.&nbsp; The Order finds that parts of the new bill violate the constitutional rights of free speech.&nbsp; In some respects, the Order only finds that the new law is unconstitutional as applied to specific facts, meaning, the ruling stops short of striking down the statute entirely.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">Legal practitioners working in areas involving rights of workers and whistleblowers to document unlawful workplace conditions are encouraged to review the Order.&nbsp; It also has ramifications for those who work in investigative media.&nbsp; The ruling is nuanced and it is important to note that privacy and access-to-information issues need to be evaluated based on their particular facts.&nbsp; For instance, in a medical setting, there may be HIPAA patient privacy laws in the mix.&nbsp; In some workplace environments, workers may have signed agreements regarding disclosure of corporate trade secrets.&nbsp; In addition, for some workplace safety violations, note that it may be a violation of law not to report dangerous and unsafe conditions.<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">In recent months, the Wallace and Graham law firm has seen an uptick in workplace whistleblower issues arising from the COVID-19 pandemic.&nbsp; The new federal court decision hopefully will mean that workers who see unsanitary and unsafe infectious disease control conditions in food production, the health care industry, and elsewhere, have the ability to document and report what is happening at their workplaces.&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">&nbsp;<u></u><u></u></p><p class=\"m_-5394833605030169682xmsonormal\">Asked to comment, founding partner of Wallace and Graham Mona Lisa Wallace stated:&nbsp; “We welcome this decision because it reinforces the rights and freedoms under our Constitution and the First Amendment.&nbsp; Free speech and a free press are important safety valves in our society.&nbsp; The new COVID-19 pandemic highlights how important it is for workers inside of affected facilities to be able to document unsafe conditions.&nbsp; By trying to gag the ability of American citizens to investigate and publicize poor conditions inside of plants, factories, nursing homes and other places of work, these laws increase the dangers not just to our freedom of speech but also to our basic safety.”</p>'

Accordius Health, owned by the Portopiccolo private equity group in New Jersey, owns and operates a chain of 50-plus facilities.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Acting on behalf of the caretakers of Marjorie Garvin, a resident at the Citadel, the Wallace and Graham law firm in Salisbury filed a claim on her behalf on April 21 in the Rowan County Superior Court. Sadly, we learned late yesterday that Margorie Garvin passed away. We are dismissing her complaint at this time to allow the family to grieve and to get her estate in order. Now, joining with Steve Gugenheim, of Gugenheim Law in Raleigh, a lawyer who has spent the last 20 years prosecuting claims of nursing home abuse and neglect, a new Complaint along with witness statements has been filed. The new claim focuses on seeking a comprehensive review of the facility’s policies. It asks the Court to review the practices of the troubled care facility in order to prevent further neglect. The current claim seeks only injunctive relief, and not monetary damages, in order to force compliance with regulations and North Carolina law.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Speaking for Wallace and Graham, Mona Lisa Wallace said: “We felt we had no choice but to file this suit in order to protect the health, safety and welfare of the elderly population and those dedicated to caring for them. The claim seeks to prevent the endangerment of the family members of residents and caregivers, our hospital workers, funeral directors and the community at large. We have received an overwhelming number of calls from families of residents, caregivers, employees and contractors. Their stories are heartbreaking. Our thoughts and prayers go out to them, and we will use our very best skills and talent to protect them and others in our community. We believe that the evidence confirms operational deficiencies on a massive scale, and we felt the most appropriate course of action was to seek Court intervention and request injunctive relief.”&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Speaking for the Gugenheim firm, Steve Gugenheim stated: “Our primary focus at this time is to fight for the health and safety of The Citadel’s residents and to ensure that The Citadel is operated in accordance with North Carolina law and follows the guidelines recommended by the CDC. We recognize and appreciate that the nurses and aides working in the trenches are doing the best they possibly can with the resources made available to them. Our goal is to ensure that the corporate owners of this for-profit nursing home provide The Citadel staff with appropriate personal protective equipment, ensure they are appropriately trained in COVID-19 pursuant to state and CDC guidelines, ensure there are sufficient staff in place to meet the care needs of the residents, ensure the facility maintains transparency and family members are timely and properly informed about the health condition of their loved ones, and ensure that The Citadel complies with all applicable laws, rules and regulations. We are concerned, based on sworn statements by multiple current and former employees, residents, and family members of residents, that the current management has not and is not taking appropriate measures to protect the health and&nbsp;</span><span>safety of residents and staff. We believe that Court intervention is necessary to ensure that management is adequately meeting the health and safety needs of its residents and staff in accordance with North Carolina law, rules and regulations.” </span></p>'

  tag: 'Educational Information',
  blog: '<p>In response to the economic devastation created by the COVID-19 crisis, Congress created the Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) as part of the CARES Act. The PPP provides extremely low-cost loans, which will be forgiven if a qualifying applicant spends the proceeds on payroll and a few other items. In the few weeks since the CARES Act has passed, a number of law firms who appear to qualify for its relief are still waiting for a response to their applications. While firms should seek out advice from all appropriate professions as they pursue support under the PPP, we set out here to offer several points that we’ve learned about the program.</p><p><strong>Tip One: Be Careful Selecting Your Bank</strong></p><p>Under the terms of the CARES Act, any qualifying small business (or qualifying non-profit) should have been able to apply through its FDIC-insured bank and there is no requirement for collateral, a credit check or the traditional trappings of a business loan. But it’s proving to be a little more complicated than that as banks set their own individual guidelines. Not all banks are proving equal in this crisis. Many larger banks have refused to accept applications from some businesses. This link on the SBA website provides a list of currently approved to file PPP loans:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.sba.gov/paycheckprotection/find" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">https://www.sba.gov/paycheckprotection/find</a>.</p><p>Experts also advise businesses to contact their local Small Business Development Center, Women’s Business Center, or SCORE, which all include experts who provide free guidance via phone and email. You can also search for lenders at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://smartasset.com/insights/ppp-loan-lenders" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">https://smartasset.com/insights/ppp-loan-lenders</a>&nbsp;and it identifies whether the lenders accept applications from non-customers.</p><p>We have heard from a number of firms that have had better experiences with small lenders. They are far more likely to accept loan applications regardless of whether you have existing business with them. The smaller lenders not only submitted and gained approval from the SBA much more quickly, but have already delivered the proceeds of the loan in most cases. In many cases, it has been very hard for firms applying for PPP to reach a human being at larger banks.</p><p><strong>Tip Two: Ask Whether Your Application Was Actually Submitted to the SBA</strong></p><p>It is apparent that some lenders have accepted applications, but have not actually submitted them to the SBA for funding. We have learned of situations where applicants were given assurances both verbally and in writing that the application was “complete” or “accepted,” but later learned that the application had not been actually submitted to the SBA and accepted.</p><p>We are aware of instances of this occurring even where the application was submitted on April 3<sup>rd</sup>, the first day that applications were accepted. More precise questioning can help to determine if you are caught in this trap. You can inquire directly to your lender whether the loan application has been actually submitted to the SBA and whether the SBA provided funding confirmation. The SBA provides an instantaneous response to properly submitted PPP applications in most cases and your lender should be able to provide that to you.</p><p>This can be happening for a variety of reasons, some more nefarious than others. Part of the problem seems to be that there is relatively little economic incentive for a lender to submit a PPP loan. The lender receives only one percentage point on the loan and the good will value of customer service. At the innocent end of the continuum, some lenders have lacked enough portals to the submissions process, making it practically difficult for them to process loans in a timely manner.</p><p>There are other lenders, though, who created their own issues by imposing lender specific requirements. According to one Maryland federal court interpreting the CARES act in a case against Bank of America, this is permissible. Still other lenders appear to have accepted applications but have no intention of submitting applications to the SBA for their own business reasons. They likely accepted the applications initially because the lender wanted to appear to be serving its business customers out of fear those business clients would migrate to another banking institution.</p><p><strong>Tip Three: Explore Multiple Possibilities</strong></p><p>Because this is a moving target, a few experts suggest filing applications with more than one lender, so that you have a better chance you have of seeing some movement with at least one of them. This is tricky, however, as you cannot actually end up submitting more than one actual application to the Small Business Administration. &nbsp;With the worry about funding running out and some lenders changing priorities, it still makes sense to inquire with several lenders. This is simply a strategy to see who can fund you faster. (Ask for institutions to contact you before submitting for approval, so you can make sure you do not accidentally apply for multiple loans, which would be fraud under the PPP Loans provisions.)</p><p>In addition to the list of lenders listed above on the SBA website, several Fintech companies like PayPal, Intuit and Square have all been approved&nbsp;to participate in the PPP program as well. It appears that their processing time is much faster because their business model and processes are built for speed.</p><p><strong>Tip Four: Move Quickly!</strong></p><p>The reason for the urgency is that the $349 billion is clearly inadequate for the magnitude of need in the American small business community and is running out quickly. The Florida Banker’s Association reported yesterday that they believe the existing funds would all be gone by today or tomorrow at the latest. Lawmakers are pushing for more funds but it hasn’t happened yet.</p>'

Based on prior months&apos; performance, a policy may provide reimbursement for profits that would have been earned had the event not occurred.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Fixed costs</i>. These can include operating expenses&nbsp;and other incurred costs of doing business.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Temporary relocation</i>. Some policies cover the costs involved with moving to and operating from a temporary business location.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Commission and training costs</i>. A company will often need to replace equipment and retrain personnel. Business interruption insurance may cover these costs.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Extra expenses</i>. Business interruption insurance may reimburse reasonable expenses (beyond the fixed costs) needed to continue operating while the business gets back on solid footing.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Government closure loss</i>. A business interruption event may result in government-mandated closure of business premises.&nbsp;Examples include forced&nbsp;closures because of government-issued&nbsp;curfews&nbsp;or street closures related to an event.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Employee wages</i>. Coverage of wages is essential if a business does not&nbsp;want to lose employees while&nbsp;shutting down. This&nbsp;coverage can help a business owner&nbsp;make payroll until the crisis passes.</span></li><li class=\"li9\"><span class=\"s3\"><i>Taxes</i>. Businesses may still have to pay taxes, even when disaster hits.

Hartford Fire Insurance Co</i>., Superior Court for the State of California, County of Napa, complaint filed March 2020.</b></span></li></ul><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Two high-class restaurants (The French Laundry and Bouchon Bistro) sued asking that the Court rule that their insurance coverage had to pay out for COVID-19 closure losses.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Their operations were shut down by a March 2020 directive from the Napa County health officer.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>This was a stay-at-home order for those who did not perform essential services.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The restaurants claim they are insured under an “all risks” policy issued by Hartford.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>They claim that their policy provides “civil authority” coverage for lost business income and extra expenses incurred if access to the restaurants is prohibited by an order of civil authority as a result of a covered loss in the area. </span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The restaurants assert that their policy coverage was triggered by the closure order issued by their local government authorities.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Further, the restaurant owners allege their policies do not include a “virus exclusion.” </span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">An issue brewing in that case is whether the insurance company can argue that to implicate the “civil authority” coverage, the claimant has to show that there was physical damage to property other than the premises.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The insurer may argue that the reason why businesses have been closed is for social distancing, not physical damage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The reason why the government ordered businesses in the area to shut down was not due to something like a tornado or other natural disaster that wrecked property in the neighborhood.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">That crux of the insurance company’s defense in this and other cases is expected to be that for business interruption coverage to apply (that is, coverage for the economic losses to an insured business owner arising out of having to close the business for a period of time), there has to be underlying physical property damage of a blatant, structural nature, such as fire damage after a lightning strike or an explosion.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">But this oversimplifies the issue.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Look at it through the claimant’s eyes.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The small business owner who buys business interruption coverage pays an extra premium for the peace of mind of knowing that if an unforeseen event forces a temporary shutdown, he has insurance coverage to help get him through it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>If main street was closed down due to a flood of toxic waste, that could trigger coverage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Here, there has been another flood, only this time, of invisible virus particles.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>And the whole reason why government authorities are ordering shutdowns is because of the physical fact of the virus itself landing and staying on surfaces and people, floating through the air and causing infection and even death.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Thus, in the <i>French Laundry Partners </i>complaint, the restaurants allege that the COVID-19 virus has physically impacted “public and private property, and physical spaces in cities around the world and in the United States.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Further, the virus “physically infects and stays on surfaces of objects or materials, ‘fomites,’ for up to twenty-eight days.” And, “China, Italy, France and Spain have implemented the cleaning and fumigating of areas” before allowing those areas to re-opened to the public. Thus, the government’s stay-at-home order was “issued based on evidence of physical damage to property.”</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">The claimants allege that they “faithfully paid policy premiums” to Hartford.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The coverage, known as “The Property Choice Business Income and Extra Expense Form,” was to be triggered “in the event of business closures by order of Civil Authority.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>(Complaint para. 14).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The coverage applies “to the actual loss of business income sustained and the actual, necessary and reasonable extra expenses incurred when access to the scheduled premises is specifically prohibited by order of civil authority as the direct result of a covered cause of loss to property in the immediate area of plaintiffs’ scheduled premises.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>(Complaint para. 15).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>“The policy is an all-risk policy, insofar as it provides that covered causes of loss under the policy means direct physical loss or direct physical damage unless the loss is specifically excluded or limited in the policy.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>(Para. 16).<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>And, according to the plaintiffs, the “policy’s Property Choice Deluxe Form specifically extends coverage to direct physical loss or damage caused by virus.”<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>(Para. 17).</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><ul class=\"list\"><li class=\"li4\"><span class=\"s1\"><b><i>Cajun Conti, LLC v.

[W]hile air may often be invisible to the naked eye, surely the fact that air has physical properties cannot reasonably be disputed. Defendant&apos;s contention implies a different definition of &apos;physical&apos; altogether.

</span>The situation caused by the virus is not that different.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Like the toxic gas spill, the Coronavirus is an incursion of an unexpected toxic substance – the virus particles themselves – which rest and persist on surfaces, and travel through the air.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Unlike things like the common cold or the flu, the COVID-19 virus particles can cause horrific percentages of hospitalization and mortality.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>When the prevalence of the virus leads to governmental temporary shutdown orders, it may be argued that the virus has caused physical loss or damage by its contaminating and destructive effect.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Unlike the common cold or the flu, the COVID-19 virus is not a common everyday occurrence that society has simply grown to live with.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Rather, like the spill of toxic chemical gases into a community, or the detection of asbestos in a school building, the virus represents an unexpected, devastating, but temporary event, which will pass once it is controlled and recedes and once a vaccine is found.&nbsp;</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">This is the kind of unexpected damage that should be covered by business insurance because it falls into the range of what ordinary business owners thought they were paying for when they paid their premiums.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>They paid premiums for insurance to cover the unlikely event of a shutdown order and temporary business closures due to an unexpected disaster.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>A small business owner needs this coverage because even though eventually the pandemic will pass and closure orders will lift, this may come too late for small businesses without deep cash reserves.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>For those who work in the people-serving, in-person-service, hospitality space, weeks of a shutdown may put them out of business forever.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>It is no surprise, then, that some have already filed claims in court.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p16\"><span class=\"s1\"><b>What You Can Do</b></span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Small business owners are advised to consult their policies and see if they contain language that provides coverage for losses incurred due to a business interruption.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>The policy language must relate to events that trigger the suspension of their business operations, such as being forced to close due to a government order.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">Also, one must check to see whether the insurance policy has an express exclusion for contamination due to communicable diseases or viruses.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>Such a “virus exclusion” may preclude a claim.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If the policy is broadly worded and does not contain such an exclusion, this is a point in the small business claimant’s favor.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp; </span>This is because if the insurer had wanted to exclude pandemic-related losses under the policy, it could have sought to do so, but did not.</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p17\"><span class=\"s1\">************</span></p><p class=\"p3\">&nbsp;</p><p class=\"p4\"><span class=\"s1\">If you need help analyzing your policy language or understanding if your business may have a valid claim, please do not hesitate to contact our firm for assistance.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\">&nbsp;

The Consumer Product Safety Commission stated that almost 18,000 individuals ended up in emergency rooms in 2017 alone.&nbsp; Injuries that can come from these parks can be life-threatening including fractured necks, fractured backs, and dislocated and open-fracture elbows.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>The problem lies in the design. Several trampolines are connected to steel chains or links under very thin padding. As people jump, they create waves of energy and as they move with that energy, when they make contact or receive contact from someone twice their weight, they can end up with crushed bones. Allowing adults and children to jump and do flips at the same time creates a risk of collision that can lead to injury or death.&nbsp; Many injuries from these parks happen to adults, but children have also been a victim to trampoline park injuries.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Injuries can also result from employee negligence including lack of supervision, poor training, lack of security, and faulty equipment.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Despite recurrent injuries and deaths, trampoline parks operate with no federal oversight, and in most cases, you will have obstacles seeking compensation if you are injured.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Upon coming to one of these parks, you are required to sign a waiver.&nbsp; These companies have deliberately made it more difficult to hold them accountable for damages caused by their parks.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Families come to these parks expecting it to be safe, not knowing that it is not safe at all.

  blog: '<p><span>Wallace & Graham’s Environmental Litigation</span></p><p>You may be aware of how the environment is being affected by climate change, fossil fuels, deforestation, or other environmental concerns. The right to a healthy environment and clean water is one of our most essential rights.&nbsp; A healthy environment promotes our natural way of life and survival. In fact, most of everything surrounding us is an extension of the environment:</p><ul class="list"><li><span>We use printed paper for our 9 to 5 jobs that comes from trees.</span></li><li><span>We use water that comes from water systems connected to streams, rivers, and lakes to wash our hands and cook our food.</span></li><li><span>We eat food grown in soil that contains nutrients that assist in food growth.</span></li></ul><p><span>The environment contributes to our daily lives in multiple ways and it is necessary and critical for us all to maintain and protect it. Wallace & Graham has worked hard to ensure that corporate actors are fulfilling that obligation and duty to our environment.</span></p><p><span>One of the most notable cases Wallace & Graham has tackled recently has been coal ash contamination. Duke Energy has been burning coal since 1911 in the Carolinas, and their first coal-fired plants were developed in Greensboro N.C., and Greenville, S.C. One of the biggest challenges is how to burn coal cleanly and sustainably.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Coal Ash contains toxins that can harshly affect individuals and the environment such as:</span></p><ul class="list"><li><span>Chromium</span></li><li><span>Arsenic</span></li><li><span>Lead</span></li><li><span>Selenium&nbsp;</span></li></ul><p><span>Coal Ash toxins can dissipate through the topsoil and have the potential to pollute waterways, groundwater, and the air. Those toxins can move through the environment by runoff and erosion. In turn, that runoff and erosion can contaminate streams and rivers that can harm wildlife.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>When the Dan River spill occurred, the residents’ quality of water was called into question. After the spill, the Coal Ash Management Act was passed by the state legislature in 2014.</span></p><p><span>In 2016, the Coal Ash Management Act was amended, and HB630 stated Duke must provide connections to public water supplies and filter systems. Several residents of neighborhoods near Duke coal plants began and continue to speak out against the effects of Coal Ash.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Wallace & Graham filed a lawsuit in Raleigh on behalf of residents that lived within one-half mile of coal ash ponds at Duke’s plants. The ponds were unlined, and litigants alleged that contaminants may have leaked and harmed their environment and property.</span></p><p><span>Our firm has worked to investigate and minimize negative environmental impacts that have affected over 400 neighbors of coal ash ponds in</span><i><span> Brown, et. al. v. Duke Energy</span></i><span>. The Duke Energy coal ash litigation is an example of just one matter that Wallace & Graham has pursued to promote a healthy environment.</span></p><p><span>Today challenges with the environment continue to press on as it becomes imperative for us to contribute, protect, sustain, and resolve issues. Wallace and Graham’s law firm is proud to be a part of litigation aimed to protect and/or restore the environment. If you have any concerns regarding nearby hazardous operations or conditions near might affect you, family, or environment please call Wallace& Graham P.A. at (704) 633-5244.</span></p><p></p>'

It is a long-term disease caused by inhaling asbestos fibers. The fibers irritate the lungs and cause scar tissue. Once scar tissue forms on the lungs, that area will not work, thus, inhibiting your ability to breathe at full capacity. The disease typically sets in from 10 to 20 years after you are exposed. Symptoms may range from none to fatal, and may include:</p><ul class="list"><li><p>Dry and crackling sounds in your lungs when you inhale;</p></li><li><p>Chest pain;</p></li><li><p>Tightness of your chest;</p></li><li><p>Persistent cough that is constantly expelling mucus;</p></li><li><p>Shortness of breath; and</p></li><li><p>Loss of appetite.</p></li></ul><p>As of 2018, there is <a href=\"science-update" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/science-update\">no cure for asbestosis</a>.

It may also affect the peritoneum – the abdominal cavity. It takes many years after exposure for asbestos to show up. Additionally, breathing in the fibers from asbestos may also cause cancer in the kidneys, esophagus, pancreas, stomach and intestines.</p><p>NC <span class=\"scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="mesothelioma" data-wsc-lang="en_US" data-wsc-id="k60s3trcctmwwkg14\">mesothelioma</span> law provides that you are entitled to a monetary award if you are suffering from <span class=\"scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="mesothelioma" data-wsc-lang="en_US" data-wsc-id="k60s3trcis93k547l\">mesothelioma</span> or if a loved one died because of <span class=\"scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="mesothelioma" data-wsc-lang="en_US" data-wsc-id="k60s3trba8tc9ke0a\">mesothelioma</span>.</p><h3>Asbestos Exposure Attorneys</h3><p>Mesothelioma attorneys specialize in claims for victims of asbestos exposure, including those with asbestosis and <span class=\"scayt-misspell-word" data-scayt-word="mesothelioma" data-wsc-lang="en_US" data-wsc-id="k60s3tug8h9jlb8qe\">mesothelioma</span> in any of its forms.

It was early in his career, and he didn’t want to be seen as a rabble-rouser.&nbsp;</p><p>“If you’re too vocal sometimes,” he says, “things can go sour.”</p><p>He dates his turning point to a crisp, sunny day in 2012. Davis and his family were living in his grandparents’ old house, across the road from where he grew up, on land that straddles Wilson and Greene Counties. He and his eight-year-old had been on a father-daughter outing. They arrived home, he says, to an odor that had wafted over from the nearby hog facility, Stantonsburg Farm. Swine operations don’t export their odor 24-7. But at its worst, the manure smells like “<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3672924/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">rotten eggs and ammonia</a>,” says the federally funded journal&nbsp;<em>Environmental Health Perspectives</em>. It chases people indoors and sticks to clothing, to the point that Davis and his wife no longer hang their laundry outside to dry.</p><p>When they stepped out of the truck, Davis says, the stink was particularly strong.</p><p>“Dad, why do we have to live like this?” he recalls his daughter asking. “When I go to my friends’ house, I don’t smell this smell.”</p><p>The question thwacked Davis. He had grown up swimming and fishing in the nearby sandpits and creeks, and expected his kids to have a footloose childhood, too. When his oldest son—now an adult—was a child, they would pitch tents on their own property and camp overnight.&nbsp;</p><p>“We didn’t go to the mountains or wherever,” he says. “We&nbsp;<em>live</em>&nbsp;in the country.”</p><p>His two younger kids have had a more ambivalent relationship to the outdoors.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s not like we stayed inside with the blinds pulled,” he says.&nbsp;</p><p>But living near Stantonsburg Farm, which has a permit to raise 4,800 pigs at a time, has meant less camping and fishing. The children didn’t have birthday parties around the swimming pool, because they never knew when the smell would chase everyone inside. That uncertainty, he says, has taken a toll.&nbsp;</p><p>“A man’s home is his castle, and he feels he needs to defend his castle, and so it makes you feel weaker,” he says. His children have noticed their parents’ helplessness, he says, and have internalized it themselves: “It makes them not as bold. Makes them not as daring. Makes them not as willing to challenge.”</p><p>Stantonsburg Farm raises the pigs for the Virginia-based Smithfield Foods, which is owned by a Chinese company. In 2014 Davis signed on as one of more than 500 plaintiffs suing Smithfield’s hog-production subsidiary, then called Murphy-Brown. The 26 lawsuits allege that industrial hog farming makes life intolerable for those living nearby—in legal parlance, that it creates a “private nuisance.” The plaintiffs live near farms contracted to, or owned by, Smithfield. They allege that the facilities produce a recurring stench and attract flies, buzzards, and late-night truck traffic.&nbsp;</p><p>The lawsuits claim that Smithfield can control the nuisance by changing how its farmers dispose of the pigs’ urine and feces. The waste is currently flushed into large open pits called “lagoons,” where it sits until growers spray it on their fields as fertilizer.</p><p>Smithfield insists that the nuisance claims are overblown and that alternative disposal technologies cost too much.&nbsp;</p><p>“From the beginning, the lawsuits have been nothing more than a money grab by a big litigation machine,”&nbsp;the company said in a 2018 statement. The company calls the suits “a serious threat to a major industry, to North Carolina’s entire economy, and to the jobs and livelihoods of tens of thousands of North Carolinians.”</p><p>But the company lost all five federal cases that went to trial in 2018 and 2019. Juries awarded 36 neighbors a total of almost $550 million, which the court dialed back to about $98 million because of a North Carolina law limiting punitive damages.&nbsp;</p><p>Davis’s case has not yet gone to trial. But on January 31, in Richmond, the Fourth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals will hold oral arguments in the first of Smithfield’s appeals. The appellate court’s decision will help determine whether Davis’s lawsuit moves forward—whether he can seek damages for what he calls his children’s diminished childhood.</p><p><strong>The case before the Fourth Circuit&nbsp;</strong>is called&nbsp;<em>McKiver vs. Murphy-Brown</em>. It involves a rural community in Bladen County and a swine facility that opened in its midst in the mid-1990s. Owner Billy Kinlaw had a contract with Smithfield’s Murphy-Brown subsidiary and a permit to raise more than 14,000 pigs at a time. Like all 26 lawsuits, this one was filed by Wallace and Graham, a Salisbury law firm that often takes on large corporations.</p><p>The trial took place at the U.S. District Court in Raleigh in April 2018. On the witness stand, Kinlaw’s neighbors recounted how the odor, buzzards, flies, and truck traffic upended their lives.&nbsp;</p><p>“My father was a sharecropper,” plaintiff Daphne McKoy, an administrative assistant, testified. “We didn’t have a lot, and what he did leave to his family was that little piece of land.”&nbsp;</p><p>Back then, she said, it was quiet, and the air was fresh: “You could spend all day on the porch or under the tree, but no one does that anymore. You can ride through and it looks like a ghost town compared to when I was coming up.”&nbsp;</p><p>Many of McKoy’s relatives still live along that road. But McKoy said she fears that when her own children grow up, they will settle down in less noxious surroundings.&nbsp;</p><p>“They’re embarrassed by the odors,” she testified. “They’re embarrassed to have their friends over.”&nbsp;</p><p>Like Randy Davis, three counties away, McKoy said she felt frustrated by her inability to give her kids a pastoral North Carolina childhood.&nbsp;</p><p>“I would like for you to know how helpless I feel as a mother to hear them complain about how the kids say, ‘Your house smells like a trash dump,’” she told the jury. “I just want you to know how sometimes hopeless and helpless it feels.”</p><p>This frustration, argued plaintiffs’ co-counsel Michael Kaeske, was as avoidable as the smell itself. “Smithfield has saved untold millions of dollars by refusing to use alternative technology that will fix the problems,” he said during his opening argument. He added that Smithfield has tried to evade responsibility for the stench.&nbsp;</p><p>One of the documents Kaeske offered as evidence was a 1999 memo from a now-retired Smithfield executive, Don Butler, lauding the state’s new odor regulations. “The rules, as written, are so vague and subjective that enforcement will be difficult,” Butler wrote. “This may be to our benefit.”</p><p>Smithfield pushed back against the plaintiffs’ narrative. “There was never an odor issue raised about the Kinlaw farm before this lawsuit,” defense attorney Mark Anderson told the jury.</p><p>Among his witnesses was Jacquelyne Creed-Enloe, a neighbor whom the Kinlaws have invited over for oyster roasts and pig pickings. Her children sometimes visit the farm, too, she testified, and feed the resident donkeys. They wouldn’t do that, she said, if the farm had a strong odor. One daughter is “really prissy,” and her son “has a keen sense of smell, and he would have a meltdown. He can’t handle gassy smells.”</p><p>Over three weeks, the jury heard from parents and children, scientists, and industry leaders who told contradictory stories of life in swine country. Then the jury delivered a decisive verdict: Not only did Smithfield harm the plaintiffs, but it also committed such “egregiously wrongful acts” that it deserved to pay punitive damages. The jury awarded the 10 plaintiffs a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indyweek.com/news/northcarolina/will-raleigh-jury-s-50-million-verdict-murphy-brown-llc-force-big-pork-clean-act/\">total of $50.75 million</a>. State law reduced the award to&nbsp;<a href=\"https://indyweek.com/news/archives/judge-britt-reduces-murphy-brown-s-punitive-damages-3.25-million/\">$3.25 million</a>.</p><p>Smithfield appealed the verdict, saying that Senior U.S. District Judge W. Earl Britt “committed numerous errors”—first among them “allowing the jury to consider and award punitive damages despite a lack of sufficient evidence.”&nbsp;</p><p>That’s the appeal that the Fourth Circuit will hear on January 31.</p><p><strong>After the&nbsp;<em>McKiver</em>&nbsp;verdict,</strong>&nbsp;Billy Kinlaw couldn’t understand how his farm, with its clean environmental record in the eyes of state government, could be the source of a multimillion-dollar jury award.&nbsp;</p><p>“Quite frankly, I’ve lost a lot of respect for the legal system,” said Kinlaw, who was not himself sued,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://thefern.org/2019/12/rural-north-carolinians-won-multimillion-dollar-judgments-against-the-worlds-largest-hog-producer-will-those-cases-now-be-overturned/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">in an interview</a>&nbsp;for an article published by the Food & Environmental Reporting Network and&nbsp;<em>The Nation</em>. “I’ve never had any type of violation, never had any type of write-up, and this is in 24 years. And now, all of a sudden, I’m a nuisance.”&nbsp;</p><p>The industry said the same thing. As part of the Fourth Circuit appeal, four industry groups argued that the court should consider the fact that state regulators have never cited Kinlaw Farms.&nbsp;</p><p>“[P]laintiffs’ legal theories do not target rogue operators who flout environmental laws,” said an amicus brief filed by the North Carolina Pork Council, North Carolina Farm Bureau Federation, and their national counterparts. “They challenge operators who comply with the law and carry out ordinary farming practices. It is no exaggeration to say that a plaintiff win in these lawsuits would subject the everyday activities of all farmers to punitive damages.”&nbsp;</p><p>If Randy Davis’s lawsuit makes it to trial, it will be harder for Smithfield and the industry to make that argument. Stantonsburg Farm, which generates an estimated 12 million gallons of hog waste a year, has received multiple write-ups by regulators over the past quarter-century.</p><p>The first came in January 1995.&nbsp;</p><p>Prakash Menon was on emergency standby for the state Division of Environmental Management when his beeper interrupted a Saturday afternoon. Menon, an environmental engineer, was summoned to Stantonsburg, where he saw stagnant pink liquid in the ditches lining both sides of a rural road. (Bacterial action turns hog waste pink.) Several neighbors, including Davis, were there to meet him.</p><p>The discharge came from Stantonsburg Farm, according to a violation notice issued by the state government. And it emptied into Contentnea Creek, where Davis had spent so much of his youth. Contentnea Creek, in turn, flows into the Neuse River.&nbsp;</p><p>“Wastewater of this nature has the potential to deplete dissolved oxygen in the affected water body to a point which is harmful to aquatic life,” said a DEM inspection report stemming from the incident. But when Menon showed up at the farm, the manager refused him entry. The engineer had to call the Greene County Sheriff’s Office for help.</p><p>On a follow-up visit, two other DEM employees found dead pigs improperly dumped in a drainage area, half-covered with water. During that visit, according to state records, the manager again was “not cooperative.”&nbsp;</p><p>The 1995 incident was one of several noted by regulators, including waste discharges in 1999, 2009, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kinston.com/article/20130410/News/304109986" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">2013</a>. All the while, neighbors continued to complain.&nbsp;</p><p>“How would you feel if you couldn’t drink the water from your own well, go to church without the smell of hog waste permeating your clothing, or even have a barbecue with friends on your own property?” said Don Webb, a plaintiff and former hog farmer, in a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://waterkeeper.org/news/groups-target-illegal-swine-waste-discharges/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">2014 statement</a>&nbsp;released by the Waterkeeper Alliance, an environmental group.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shingletonfh.com/obituaries/Don-Webb-4/#!/Obituary" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">Webb died in 2018</a>.</p><p>Stantonsburg Farm is owned by Murphy Family Ventures, a company founded and headed by Wendell “Dell” Murphy Jr. He’s the son of Wendell Murphy Sr., who pioneered the expansion of North Carolina’s swine industry and also served in the state legislature from 1983–93. As&nbsp;<em>The News & Observer</em>&nbsp;chronicled in “<a href=\"https://www.pulitzer.org/winners/news-observer-raleigh-nc" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">Boss Hog</a>,” its 1995 Pulitzer-winning investigation, the elder Murphy and his legislative allies championed laws to protect the industry, including sales-tax exemptions and restrictions on county zoning powers.&nbsp;</p><p>Smithfield’s subsidiary, Murphy-Brown, leased and managed Stantonsburg Farm from 2002–12.&nbsp;</p><p>Smithfield declined an interview request for this article and declined to answer questions by email. Representatives of Murphy Family Ventures and Stantonsburg Farm did not return phone calls.&nbsp;</p><p>In its formal response to the lawsuit, Smithfield acknowledged “a few instances where application of effluent at the Stantonsburg Farm resulted in runoff onto neighboring land and waterways.” The company added that the farm and its owners “undertook efforts immediately to remediate any runoff,” and that Smithfield has worked with the farm to minimize the smell and generally improve its environmental performance.</p><p>Over the past three years, Davis says he’s noticed a change: “The hog operation has been very minimal nuisance.” He wonders if this is a result of the lawsuit.&nbsp;</p><p>The relief has brought Davis little comfort.&nbsp;</p><p>“Some people say, ‘Well, aren’t you happy about that?’ Well, no. That made me mad as hell.” To him, the improvement shows that Stantonsburg Farm could have mitigated the odors all along. “But it cost pennies more to do it, where you can be a better neighbor versus you don’t give a crap about your neighbor.”</p><p>“The last three years of my life living here has been great,” he says. “The prior 20 years, it was hell.”</p></div></div></article></div></div></div></div></div><div class=\"at-share-dock-outer addthis-smartlayers at4-visually-hidden addthis-smartlayers-mobile\">&nbsp;</div>'

  tag: 'Asbestosis & Mesothelioma',
  blog: '<p>A new study by the <em>Journal of Occupational and Environmental Medicine</em> shows that baby powder contains talc that causes cancer. While several jury trials were in favor of the patients, Johnson & Johnson appealed most of them on the grounds that the cases have conflicting evidence and “no proof.” To understand why baby powder might have cancer-causing talc – or asbestos – in it, you have to understand a few things, including the in it, you have to understand a few things, including the difference between talc and asbestos.</p><h3>Talc and Asbestos</h3><p>Both elements occur naturally on earth and both are mined products. However, a talc deposit might be contaminated with chrysotile asbestos, which is the cancer-causing agent. Once the miners mine the talc, they must purify it to get rid of the chysotile asbestos, if the deposit they found was contaminated. The <a href=\"johnson-johnson-baby-powder-recalled-due-to-asbestos-exposure/" target=\"_blank\" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/johnson-johnson-baby-powder-recalled-due-to-asbestos-exposure/\">chemical makeup</a> for both products are very similar. In fact, they both contain magnesium, silicon, oxygen and hydrogen, but in different amounts. It’s when you have more or less of one or more of the elements that determine whether the element causes cancer or is harmless talc.</p><h3>Why Baby Powder Causes Mesothelioma</h3><p>In some cases, the miners do not get all of the chrysotile asbestos out of the mined talc, and the cancer-causing agent ends up in talcum powder. The FDA does not regulate beauty products, and that includes talcum powder. The above-mentioned study looked at 33 people, all of whom the researchers were able to show had no other exposure to anything that caused mesothelioma other than the baby powder. All 33 people had mesothelioma and all 33 used baby powder consistently.</p><p>When consumers use baby powder that is laced with chrysotile asbestos on a daily basis, or even several times per week, they breathe in the talcum dust, which contains asbestos. It’s the traces of asbestos in the talcum powder that causes cancer, not the talc itself. There have also been a few cases where women using baby powder for feminine hygiene have gotten ovarian cancer because of the asbestos in the baby powder.</p><p>While researchers have advised people to use something other than baby powder, those who have been using it for many years still have the risk of developing cancer from the chrysotile asbestos that was not removed from the talc before it went into baby powder.</p><h3><strong>Talc and Asbestos in Other Products</strong></h3><p>Baby powder is not the only cosmetic that uses talc. You can find talc in blush and other beauty products. However, the type of asbestos found in talc is not the same as the type of asbestos found in insulation and other products. Because of this, researchers were able to pin down the reasons for mesothelioma and ovarian cancer as cosmetics, including baby powder, made from talc. If you are currently using baby powder or other products with talc in them, you should switch to a substitute product that does not have talc in it. If you have been using baby powder for many years, especially on a daily basis, you should keep an eye out for the symptoms of mesothelioma and ovarian cancer.</p><h3>Contact Wallace & Graham</h3><p>If you have a diagnosis of mesothelioma or ovarian cancer and you frequently use baby powder, <a href=\"contact-us" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/contact-us\">contact Wallace & Graham</a> to set up a consultation to discuss your case.</p>'

  tag: 'Asbestosis & Mesothelioma',
  blog: '<p>During recent testing in October 2019, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) found that one lot of Johnson’s Baby Powder contained chrysotile asbestos. At the same time, the FDA tested another lot, and that lot was not tainted with asbestos. The FDA recommended those who had baby powder from the tainted lot – Lot #22318RB – to return the powder or at the very least, get rid of it since asbestos could cause cancer.</p><h3>How Does Talc Get Contaminated with Asbestos?</h3><p>Talc and asbestos are naturally occurring products. However, when the miners find a talc deposit, they must be sure that the site isn’t contaminated with chrysotile asbestos. Miners also have to purify the talc ore so that it doesn’t contain chysotile asbestos. The two minerals are closely related and are found in similar areas. In fact, the <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Chrysotile" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/Chrysotile\">chemical make up for chrysotile asbestos</a> is Mg<sub>3</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>H<sub>4</sub>O<sub>9</sub>, Mg<sub>3</sub>(Si<sub>2</sub>O<sub>5</sub>)(OH)<sub>4</sub> or H<sub>4</sub>Mg<sub>3</sub>O<sub>9</sub>Si<sub>2</sub>, depending on the type of chrysotile asbestos, while the <a href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/talc" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/compound/talc\">chemical formula for talc</a> is H<sub>2</sub>Mg<sub>3</sub>O<sub>12</sub>Si<sub>4</sub>. As you can see, asbestos and talc both contain magnesium, silicon, oxygen and hydrogen.</p><h3>Talc Recall</h3><p>Because the FDA found chrysotile asbestos in that one batch of talc, Johnson & Johnson voluntarily recalled Johnson’s Baby Powder. Asbestos is a carcinogen, which causes cancer. Although cosmetics are held to a lower standard than food and do not have to be reviewed by the FDA, manufacturers must be sure that no harm comes to users. The FDA sporadically tests talc and cosmetics. However, the agency worked on an on-going survey since 2018 and will continue testing. Thus far, the FDA tested about 50 cosmetic products. Two lots of Johnson’s Baby Powder were included in this testing.</p><p>Because chrysotile asbestos was found in one of the lots, the FDA will continue to test samples of cosmetic products that contain talc, including baby powder, though the agency’s available resources are limited.</p><h3>The Cancer Fight</h3><p>Some patients blamed <a href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/johnsonandjohnson-cancer/\">ovarian cancer and mesothelioma</a> on the use of Johnson’s baby powder. Johnson & Johnson deny that their product has dangerous levels of asbestos in it. However, if the asbestos that might be in baby powder reaches the ovaries, it could cause ovarian cancer. It could also cause mesothelioma.</p><p>Allegedly, Johnson & Johnson tested their product as early as the 1970s and found asbestos in it, but deferred to the FDA’s findings. However, the FDA does not test every lot, so it’s hit or miss as to whether the FDA will find asbestos in the talc used to make baby powder.</p><p>If you have ovarian cancer or mesothelioma and suspect the use of baby powder might have caused it, contact Wallace & Graham to discuss your situation. We will help you notify the FDA that the use of baby powder may have caused your cancer.</p><p>The fight against contaminated baby powder is not new – people have been making accusations against talc companies for decades. However, it is only recently that some juries have been siding with those living with cancer after reviewing evidence, especially those with ovarian cancer.</p><h3>Contact Wallace & Graham</h3><p>If you have ovarian cancer or mesothelioma, or another cancer that may have been caused by asbestos and you use a lot of talc products, contact Wallace & Graham for a consultation to discuss your case.</p>'

His medical expenses exceeded $60,000, and he later learned that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina, which he assumed was his health insurance provider, had denied his claims.</p><p>After a self-pay discount from the hospital, Gray still owed more than $18,000, toward which he had to make monthly payments. Blue Cross also had declined to pay anything for the prescription drugs and physical therapy he required.</p><p>Gray is among five Rowan Countians listed as lead plaintiffs in a class-action lawsuit filed on behalf of former Durafiber workers Monday in Civil Superior Court. They are represented by the Salisbury law firm of Wallace & Graham, with Mona Lisa Wallace and John Hughes as their attorneys.</p><p>The other Durafiber workers in the lawsuit are Gary Honbarger, Monica Raney, Crystal Reese and Norman Richard Rufty.</p><p>Named as defendants in the case are Blue Cross and Blue Shield of North Carolina; Frank Papa, chief executive officer of Durafiber; Erwin Bette, chief financial officer of Durafiber; and FTI Consulting, the chief restructuring officer that handled the Durafiber bankruptcy.</p><p>The suit asks for a jury trial.</p><p>The closed plant is at 7401 Statesville Blvd. (U.S. 70). Over the years, depending on ownership, it went by Fiber Industries, Hoechst Celanese, Kosa, Invista, Performance Fibers, and, from 2014 until its closing, Durafiber Technologies.</p><p>According to the action, Blue Cross provided group health benefits to Durafiber workers based on “stripped-down coverage under an ‘administrative service only’ or ASO product.”</p><p>Under the arrangement, Durafiber had the obligation to fund the health care plan.</p><p>The suit alleges&nbsp;Papa and Bette, looking to minimize costs and shed as many company obligations to the workers while plant closings and bankruptcy were underway, knew the ASO arrangement with Blue Cross “would allow them to ignore and avoid paying numerous claims.”</p><p>In effect during the bankruptcy, the suit alleges, Durafiber was treating workers with &nbsp;group health benefit claims “like ordinary vendors they could ignore.”</p><p>But the plaintiffs claim that even though Durafiber had the obligation to fund the group health plan, Blue Cross had its own duties to “provide truthful and accurate claim information to participants, such as whether there were really funds to pay claims.”</p><p>The suit says Blue Cross represented to Durafiber workers that they had coverage. As late as Sept. 27, 2017, Blue Cross was sending written certifications to plan participants that assured them they were covered until Sept. 30, 2017.</p><p>The workers carried Blue Cross/Blue Shield cards. They received Blue Cross-drafted benefits booklets through their network providers.</p><p>After company officials held a plant meeting in July 2017 about the possible plant closures in Salisbury, Shelby and Winnsboro, many of the Durafiber workers began scheduling medical appointments and procedures because they had been told their insurance coverage would end Sept. 30.</p><p>Their premiums continued to be deducted from their paychecks. They learned later from doctors and hospitals that Blue Cross was denying their claims.</p><p>“After lengthy delays,” the suit says, “Blue Cross refused to pay the claims, declaring to the aggrieved plan participants that per the Blue Cross ASO contract, which workers never saw, Durafiber had the obligation to fund the plan.</p><p>“… As a result, the plaintiffs, who had now lost their jobs after Durafiber closed, were barraged by unexpected medical bills and charges. Many had their credit ratings devastated by no fault of their own,” the suit says.</p><p>The suit contends Blue Cross still had obligations to the workers.</p><p>“Blue Cross knew or should have known that Durafiber was failing to make payments and was a corrupt ‘plan administrator,&apos;” the action says. “Blue Cross continued to administer the plan as if all was well, assuring plaintiffs they were covered and never warning them otherwise.</p><p>“Blue Cross breached its duty to competently manage the plan.”</p><p>As for Papa, the suit contends his July 13, 2017, letter to employees misrepresented that the coverage cutoff for their group health plan was Oct. 1, 2017.</p><p>The suit also claims Papa and Bette controlled what claims were paid and that FTI Consulting, the restructuring officer, “contributed to cause the failure to pay valid benefit claims of workers receiving medical care under the plan.”</p><p>The suit adds, “None of the plaintiffs knew that Durafiber and its top executives were planning to manipulate assets and liabilities so as to leave ordinary workers holding the bag and facing ruinous medical expenses because Durafiber refused to self-fund the benefits plan.”</p><p>“It just breaks my heart,” Wallace said in a telephone Monday. “Our clients thought they had (coverage).”</p>'

  blog: '<p>Workers’ compensation laws state that every employer who has at least one person working for it must have workers’ compensation insurance. Private companies, federal organizations, local government organizations must all provide this insurance. Workers&nbsp;compensation laws also cover subcontractors. The insurance covers employees who are work or become sick on the job. It covers medical treatment, wage replacement, vocational rehabilitation and other benefits.</p><h3>How Does Workmans Comp Work?</h3><p>If you become sick or injured on the job, workers’ compensation insurance covers the illness or injury. The injury or illness must take place at work. Common claims include slip and falls, strains from heavy lifting, workplace violence, overexertion, falling, machinery accidents and employees getting hit by an object. If you became sick because of your workplace—not just because you caught a cold, but because you got cancer from working with chemicals on the job or another disease or illness because of the workplace, you might be covered by workers’ compensation.</p><p>Before you make a claim, ask yourself, “How does workers’ compensation work?” Visit your attorney before you take action, especially if you have a long-term disability or illness. While benefits include hospital and medical expenses, it only pays two-thirds of your salary. Every state’s workers’ comp laws are different. If your injury or illness is something you should be suing for, you need to <a href=\"how-does-worker-s-compensation-work/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/how-does-worker-s-compensation-work/\">speak to a workers’ comp attorney</a> before you file.</p><h3>Settlement for Workers’ Compensation</h3><p>A settlement for workers&nbsp;compensation has many benefits, but it also has many restrictions. While it does pay for medical expenses, you may have to get authorization for any medical treatment other than emergency medical treatment. If you obtain authorization, it may cover your medical expenses, including mobility equipment, including a special vehicle, wheelchair or walker. If you need therapy, it may cover that, whether psychological, cognitive or physical therapy, once approved.</p><p>Since workers’ compensation only covers approved medical practices, it might not cover an experimental drug or therapy that your doctor may prescribe. If you want or need alternative medicine or experimental treatment, you should contact an attorney.</p><p>Your <a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/types-of-workers-compensation-benefits-32962.html" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/types-of-workers-compensation-benefits-32962.html\">workers’ compensation settlement</a> may payout for:</p><ul class="list"><li><p>Medical expenses;</p></li><li><p>Disability benefits;</p></li><li><p>Death benefits; and</p></li><li><p>Rehabilitation benefits.</p></li></ul><p>In many cases, workers’ compensation might not cover everything. You do have the option to sue your employer. Before you apply for workers’ compensation, contact Wallace and Graham, P.A., to set up a consultation to discuss your case.</p><h3>How Does Workers’ Comp Pay You?</h3><p>Since workers’ compensation is a no-fault program, the injured employee, in most cases, cannot sue the employer for his or her injuries; thus, it is important to contact a workers’ comp lawyer before you file for benefits. In some cases, it might be beneficial to use the workers’ comp insurance, while in others, it might be more beneficial to sue the employer.</p><p>A <a href=\"https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/how-does-workers-compensation-work-35401" target="_parent" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.hg.org/legal-articles/how-does-workers-compensation-work-35401\">workers&nbsp;compensation exemption</a> also applies to some workers. Though every state is different, some workers that might not have coverage, including domestic workers, agricultural workers, independent contractors and seasonal workers. These workers would have to file a lawsuit against the employer to recover damages from an accident or illness.</p><p>Additional exemptions may include whether the employee was under the influence, intentional acts of the employee or employer and/or self-inflicted injuries. When you notify your employer that you suffered an injury on the job, it should give you a form to fill out and fact sheets that outline your rights, including answering the question, “How does workers&nbsp;comp pay you?”</p><h3>Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.</h3><p>Workers’ compensation is a complicated area of law. While you should be able to file a claim on your own, it is better to retain an attorney, especially if you believe that the benefits offered will not cover your injuries or if your injuries are expected to be long-term. <a href=\"workers-compensation-injury-claims" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/workers-compensation-injury-claims\">Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.</a> to schedule a consultation and to learn more about workers’ compensation benefits.</p>'

That is up 16 percentage points from a similar Reuters/Ipsos poll that ran in the spring of 2016.</p><p><span>&nbsp;</span><span>It also found that only 29% of adults think vaping is a good way to help people quit smoking, and 77% said that vaping should be regulated at least as strongly as traditional cigarettes.</span></p><p>The survey was conducted Sept. 17-18, shortly before U.S. health officials lifted to 530 the number of confirmed and probable cases of lung-related illnesses linked to vaping. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration is investigating what has caused the outbreak that has so far killed seven people.</p><p>Retail giant Walmart also said Friday that it would pull e-cigarettes from its shelves due to health concerns and their apparent popularity among teenagers.</p><p>“This is the natural consequence of a seemingly unending stream of misleading news stories” about e-cigarettes, said Greg Conley, president of the American Vaping Association, an advocacy group that is partially funded by e-cigarette makers.</p><p>Conley added that many of the vaping-related health issues involved people who used e-cigarettes to smoke street-bought drugs or liquids that contain ingredients from cannabis, not tobacco.</p><p>Investigators at the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have pointed to vaping oils containing marijuana ingredient tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) or vaping oils with vitamin E acetate, a substance used in some THC products, as a possible cause of the illnesses. But they have not ruled out anything yet, including conventional nicotine liquids.</p><p>E-cigarettes, which operate by heating a liquid that contains nicotine, have been popular for nearly a decade in the United States. While long-term health impacts from vaping remain largely unknown, some users view e-cigarettes as a healthier alternative that can help them quit smoking.</p><p>Earlier this month, the FDA issued a warning letter to Juul Labs Inc for marketing its e-cigarettes as safer than traditional cigarettes. Juul, which has said it is reviewing the FDA letter, also faces about 30 lawsuits alleging it illegally marketed products to children and failed to issue warnings to consumers about their dangers.</p><p><span>Juul has denied that it marketed its products to children.</span></p><p><span>Younger adults were much more likely than older people to have used vaping products, according to the poll. About half of all 18-34-year-olds said they either currently use a vaping device, or they have used one in the past - about five times the rate of usage of adults who were 55 or older.</span></p><p><strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><span>The poll did not measure the interest in vaping among minors. While it is illegal to sell nicotine delivery products to minors, the FDA has said more than 3 million U.S. high school students used e-cigarettes in 2018.</span></p><p>The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online, in English, throughout the United States. It gathered responses from 1,111 adults and has a credibility interval, a measure of precision, of 3 percentage points.</p><p><strong></strong></p>'

An individual, business, or an employee could cause injury to another person. Personal injury cases could get complicated, so you should always retain a lawyer for personal injury claims, even something you might believe is small.</span></p><p><span>Cases that fall under the broad umbrella of </span><a href=\"https://www.injuryclaimcoach.com/personal-injury-claim.html\"><span>personal injury</span></a><span> include:</span></p><ul class="list"><li><span>Criminal acts that cause injury, including assault, battery, DUI and domestic violence;</span></li><li><span>Injuries to children at school or daycare;</span></li><li><span>Injuries suffered while playing sports or taking part in other recreational activities;</span></li><li><span>Work-related injuries;</span></li><li><span>Wrongful death cases, including nursing home deaths, car accident fatalities, and medical malpractice;</span></li><li><span>Dog bites;</span></li><li><span>Slip-and-falls;</span></li><li><span>Vehicle accidents; and</span></li><li><span>Product liability.</span></li></ul><p><span>A simple personal injury definition is that a person was injured because of the actions or inactions of another person or entity.</span></p><h3><span>How to Make a Personal Injury Claim</span></h3><p><span>The best way to make a </span><a href=\"https://www.nolo.com/legal-encyclopedia/personal-injury-claim\"><span>personal injury claim</span></a><span> is to contact a personal injury law attorney. When the attorney reviews your case, he or she will advise you as to whether you should try to settle or litigate the matter. Since it costs less to settle a claim than it does to litigate a claim, less for extenuating circumstances, you should try to settle first. The first step in a settlement is to write a demand letter. The letter may be ignored or you may get a response with a counter offer.</span></p><p><span>If the counteroffer is too low, you have two choices: Send another offer or let the defendant know that you will be taking the matter to trial. The defendant’s attorney may ask for discovery, even during settlement proceedings. You will have to provide documents that are requested. These usually include medical bills and other documents relating to the incident.</span></p><p><span>If you plan on going straight to </span><a href=\"https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/personal-injury/how-file-claim.html\"><span>litigation</span></a><span>, you need to have all the pertinent information. Once you file a lawsuit, you can’t add more requests. For example, if you file a lawsuit, then three months later, you learn that you will need physical therapy for the next three years, but didn’t ask for future medical bills in the original lawsuit, you won’t be able to add that in.</span></p><p><span>Documents you may need for settlement purposes and/or litigation might include:</span></p><ul class="list"><li><span>Police report if the authorities were called, such as in a vehicle accident or a dog bite accident;</span></li><li><span>Any video that may have been taken, whether from security cameras or cell phones, of the incident;</span></li><li><span>A financial affidavit;</span></li><li><span>Doctors’ notes and other medical documents regarding your diagnosis, current care, and future care; and</span></li><li><span>Bills and invoices from hospitals, doctors, vehicle repair shops and other third parties that provided you services related to the accident.</span></li><li><span>Pictures of the accident, if possible.</span></li></ul><p><span>If you are filing a lawsuit, your attorney will draft a “complaint” with all the facts relating to the incident and will ask the court to award you compensation.</span></p><h3><span>When to Call a Personal Injury Lawyer</span></h3><p><span>Though many people may tell you that you don’t need to hire a </span><a href=\"how-to-choose-a-personal-injury-lawyer\"><span>personal injury lawyer</span></a><span>, it’s always a good idea to at the very least, schedule a consultation with an attorney to discuss your case, your rights and&nbsp;</span><span>the benefits of using a lawyer. Don&apos;t rely on your insurance company to provide personal injury protection. Remember, they going to watch out for their bottom line, which means they will offer you the least amount possible to make you happy.</span></p><p><span>When you schedule a consultation, bring copies of any documents, videos, and pictures you have that you think might be helpful. If you don’t know how to get a specific document or are having trouble getting the information you need, the attorney will help you get it.</span></p><p><span>You should contact a personal injury lawyer as soon as possible after an accident. If you are a relative contacting a wrongful death attorney on behalf of a loved one, you should also contact the attorney as soon as possible, especially if you were a witness to the event that caused the death.</span></p><h3><span>Contact Wallace and Graham</span></h3><p><span>If you have suffered an injury because of the actions or inactions of another person or entity, </span><a href=\"personal-injury-car-motorcycle-trucking-accidents\"><span>contact Wallace and Graham</span></a><span> as soon as possible to set up a consultation.</span></p>'

Barbot previously served as medical director for New York City’s schools and Baltimore’s health commissioner from 2010 to 2014. She was also the chief of pediatrics and community medicine at a health clinic in Washington, D.C.</span></i></p><p><span>As a pediatrician, the beginning of the school year makes me think about both the exciting opportunities for children ahead and the health challenges they face. Guarding against unhealthy choices can be especially fraught for middle-school students, as they navigate new independence and friendships.</span></p><p><span>For today’s middle-school students, that now includes the threat of nicotine addiction — and new Health Department </span><span>data</span><span> released this week reveals the extent of this threat. We are contending with an escalating public health crisis.</span></p><p><span>In New York City last year, about 13,000, or 1 in 15, middle-school students reported that they currently use electronic cigarettes. The numbers also rose considerably by grade: 2.6% of 6th graders use e-cigarettes versus 8.4% of 8th graders.</span></p><p><span>Meanwhile, e-cigarettes are eroding historical gains in reducing the number of children potentially addicted to nicotine. Seventh graders were nine times more likely to use e-cigarettes than conventional cigarettes, while their 8th grade schoolmates were 6 times as likely to use e-cigarettes.</span></p><p><span>One of the many alarming things about these numbers is that e-cigarettes only became popular less than a decade ago. I have seen firsthand the dangers of nicotine use for young people. Part of my counseling as a pediatrician for parents and youth was educating them about the </span><span>dangers</span><span> of tobacco and nicotine.</span></p><p><span>Nicotine is a highly addictive substance — found in almost all e-cigarettes — and can change the chemistry of the teen brain, worsening memory and concentration for young people. In addition, the aerosol from e-cigarettes can contain cancer-causing chemicals such as formaldehyde and benzene; diacetyl, a chemical linked to serious lung disease; and heavy metals, including nickel, tin and lead.</span></p><p><span>The new data on youth vaping in New York City also coincides with alarming news from across the country of more than 380 probable or confirmed cases of severe lung illness associated with vaping, including six deaths.</span></p><p><span>The Trump administration supports a ban on the sale of most flavored e-cigarettes. I hope President Donald Trump’s words will match his actions. The federal government must act in order to protect thousands of children across the country. Although the details and exact cause of this illness are still being investigated by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, these cases highlight how much remains unknown about potential health impacts of vaping. Regardless, none of these products are safe for our youth.</span></p><p><span>Yet the tobacco industry is still raising hundreds of millions of dollars to increase sales in products that represent the future of nicotine addiction. The Marlboro maker, Altria Group, </span><span>$325 million</span><span> just last month to expand its reach.</span></p><p><span>In a two-day hearing this summer, Congress and the FDA slammed Juul for its role in driving the youth vaping epidemic. The investigative </span><span>hearing</span><span> detailed what has long been reported, that Juul infiltrated schools, summer camps and youth programs — its products are becoming a part of the childhood experience for American youth.</span></p><p><span>Juul has since pulled many of its flavored products out of retail stores, but that is only leading to copycat products. The latest threat is “</span><span>Juul-alikes</span><span>,” which are compatible with Juul devices and come in candy and fruity flavors that appeal to kids — pina colada, cinnamon roll and strawberry donuts, to name a few.</span></p><p><span>We’ve seen this before. Tobacco companies will choose money over health every time.</span></p><p><span>Big Tobacco deployed nefarious </span><a href=\"https://www.tobaccofreekids.org/assets/factsheets/0208.pdf\"><span>tactics</span></a><span> to promote menthol use in black neighborhoods; they lowered the price of these cigarettes in those communities and even handed them out for free. They poured millions into advertising. These strategies worked — currently </span><a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/assets/doh/downloads/pdf/smoke/menthol-tobacco-products-factsheet.pdf\"><span>more than 85%</span></a><span> of black Americans who smoke choose menthol cigarettes, compared with fewer than 5% in the 1950s.</span></p><p><span>Today, smoking remains a leading cause of death in New York City; about </span><a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/smoking-nyc-quits.page\"><span>12,000</span></a><span> New Yorkers die from smoking-related causes each year.</span></p><p><span>We cannot allow Big Tobacco to do the same damage to young people with e-cigarettes.</span></p><p><span>As the City’s doctor, my advice to parents and young people is to stop using vaping products and learn more about the health risks of vaping. The popularity of e-cigarettes has risen extremely quickly, and we are only beginning to understand the full extent of the dangers. The </span><a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/tobacco/data_statistics/fact_sheets/cessation/quitting/index.htm\"><span>CDC</span></a><span> and </span><a href=\"https://www1.nyc.gov/site/doh/health/health-topics/smoking-nyc-quits.page\"><span>Health Department</span></a><span> websites have helpful resources, including fact sheets for both youth and parents, and information on the dangers of flavored tobacco and vaping products.</span></p><p><span>We have concrete evidence that youth vaping is a frightening reality — even for children as young as 11. I urge everyone to use our data to advocate against Big Tobacco and call on your elected officials to act. The legislation before the New York City Council to ban the sale of flavored e-cigarettes that target youth is an important step in the right direction. We must put the health of our children first.</span></p>'

An employer, whether public or private, must have insurance if it has at least one employee. If you work as a subcontractor for a private firm, and you are not an employee, you cannot collect workers compensation. You do not get a workers&apos; compensation settlement, so to speak, as it doesn’t come in one lump sum. You generally get weekly payments that cover you while you are not able to work. These payments are about two-thirds of your salary. However, workers compensation does pay for medical expenses and death benefits if your loved one died in a work-related accident, and these benefits could be considered as a settlement.</p><p>If you do want to settle the claim, you most likely will not be entitled to any more payments. You should always contact a workers&apos; compensation attorney before you make such a decision.</p><h3>How Long Do Workers’ Compensation Claims Take?</h3><p>A claim may take a varying amount of time depending on the circumstances. The&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workcomp" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workcomp\">state’s workers compensation board</a>&nbsp;investigates the accident prior to approving you for workers compensation. If you work for the federal government, the Department of Labor Office of Workers Compensation Programs administers the programs.</p><p>If you are applying for a workers&apos; compensation future medical settlement because of long-term injuries, approval for a short-term claim may come before any long-term settlement. You will have to provide medical evidence that shows you may be entitled to future payments because of a long-term injury.</p><p>If you do decide to settle, you must go through a hearing to review the settlement. If the workers&apos; compensation hearing officer or judge deems that you understand the settlement and believes the settlement to be fair, the officer or judge will approve the settlement. Settlements take longer than accepting payments because you have to work out a fair amount, negotiate that amount and then attend the hearing.</p><h3>Workers’ Compensation Settlement Payouts</h3><p>If you wish to apply for a workers&apos; compensation settlement back injury, you may want to discuss your choices with an attorney. Back injuries and other catastrophic injuries are often long-term and sometimes permanent injuries.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/workers-compensation/should-you-settle-case.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.alllaw.com/articles/nolo/workers-compensation/should-you-settle-case.html\">Workers comp settlement</a>&nbsp;amounts may not be enough to cover the amount of time you are out of work or future medical bills, especially if you settle on your own. An attorney experienced in workers compensation law may be able to get you a fair settlement that could cover catastrophic injuries.</p><p>If your state covers medical expenses even if you settle a workers&apos; compensation claim, the insurance company may not pay the medical bills quickly, if at all.</p><p>Additionally, even if you do come to an agreement with the insurer, the state workers&apos; compensation agency must approve the settlement, including the amount that you will receive. It is best to consider whether the amount will be enough to cover everything, and if not, keep the claim open.</p><h3>Determining a Settlement Amount</h3><p>It is often difficult to determine an appropriate amount for long-term injuries. workers&apos;&nbsp;compensation attorneys will attempt to figure an amount that best covers what benefits you might be entitled to in the future—that is, if you were to keep the payments, and whether you would actually keep receiving the payments. Workers comp claims do not take pain and suffering, the loss of a loved one, loss of consortium, loss of companionship or punitive damages into consideration.</p><p>The amount for the settlement only covers you for lost time from work and medical benefits based on your medical records. And, if you are permanently disabled because of the injury, the claim must consider present value—that is, how much the insurance company will pay out over the next 20 years.</p><h3>Contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.</h3><p>If you have been injured at work,&nbsp;<a href=\"workers-compensation-injury-claims\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/workers-compensation-injury-claims\">contact Wallace and Graham, P.A.</a>&nbsp;as soon as possible to discuss your case.

  blog: '<p>Determining an average settlement for a personal injury claim is difficult to do because of the different types of injuries and the scope of those injuries. Smaller&nbsp;personal injury claims&nbsp;may settle for an average of about $52,900. However,&nbsp;<a href=\"what-is-a-pi-lawyer" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/personal-injury-car-motorcycle-trucking-accidents\">NC personal injury attorneys</a>&nbsp;could help you get much more for those with severe injuries or in cases where the actions of another person or company caused permanent injury or death. People who retained personal injury law firms Charlotte NC got about 340 percent higher settlement than those who tried to settle on their own.</p><p>The higher amounts are usually because of negotiations—attorneys generally don’t take the first number offered by the insurance company. Additionally, if the defendant is found to be negligent, punitive damages may be awarded, and that increases the settlement by quite a bit.</p><h3>Personal Injury Settlement Benefits</h3><p>Retaining a personal injury lawyer, even if you have personal injury insurance or some other type of personal injury coverage is more beneficial than trying to settle the case yourself. In addition to the statistically higher amounts plaintiffs get in a settlement, a personal injury attorney takes a lot of the stress of your case off your shoulders. Some benefits include:</p><ul class="list"><li><p>Every court follows rules of civil procedure. In the event that your case doesn’t settle and instead, goes to trial, you could find out that your case has been dismissed if you don’t follow the rules.</p></li><li><p>Most types of personal injuries are backed by case law, particularly those that involve negligence. A personal injury attorney will be able to use statutes and case law to help you get a better settlement or a better outcome at trial if there was a precedent set for a case like yours.</p></li><li><p>Attorneys are used to dealing with insurance companies. In some cases, you may have to deal with more than one or two insurance companies. Working a settlement or bringing a case through litigation can get confusing when you are dealing with lawyers for so many insurance companies.</p></li><li><p>An attorney does research on the costs of personal injury claims and the medical bills that go along with it. While your medical bills may not be the same as another person who finds themselves in your situation, the attorney still has a good idea as to the cost of medical care and how much more care you might need. Because of this, the attorney will not let the insurance company throw out a low offer to settle.</p></li></ul><p>Almost all&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.hg.org/torts.html" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://www.hg.org/torts.html\">types of personal injury cases</a>&nbsp;have insurance companies involved. A dog bite case may have a homeowner’s insurance company involved while someone struck by a drunk driver has his own insurance company plus the other driver’s insurance company involved in the lawsuit.</p><p>A product liability case may have even more attorneys involved. For example, if a part on your vehicle was defective and caused an accident, your own insurance company and the other driver’s insurance company could be involved. Additionally, lawyers for the vehicle manufacturer, the vehicle manufacturer’s insurance company, the part manufacturer and the part manufacturer’s insurance company may also be involved. That is six sets of attorneys you have to keep up with and make sure every one of them gets copies of documents.</p><p>If you’ve ever been involved in a court case before, you know that trying to schedule a hearing between your attorney, you, the other person and the other person’s attorney can be difficult. Imagine doing that with six sets of attorneys! And, if you are trying to settle, you also have to negotiate a settlement amount from one or more of these attorneys.</p><h3>Contact Wallace and Graham</h3><p>If you have been injured in an accident or have a relative who has been injured but cannot call us because that person is physically incapable due to injuries, contact&nbsp;<a href=\"personal-injury-car-motorcycle-trucking-accidents" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\" data-cke-saved-href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/personal-injury-car-motorcycle-trucking-accidents\">Wallace and Graham</a>&nbsp;to set up a consultation.</p>'

Federal workers, subcontractors and those who work for local government agencies and private companies are covered by worker’s compensation. </span><a href=\"https://www.dol.gov/general/topic/workcomp\"><span>Worker’s compensation benefits</span></a><span> are designed to mitigate the financial burden that occurs due to a workplace injury or occupational disease.

Even though most employers implement safety methods to prevent slips and falls, it still happens. Those people with construction jobs or factory jobs are more likely to incur a machinery accident. Having a disgruntled employee or working with a high-risk population, such as criminals, can increase the incidence of workplace violence. Falling is quite frequent due to stairs and ladders.

Most of the profits go overseas.&nbsp; Meanwhile, the waste stays here.&nbsp;</p><p>After years without change, finally the neighbors sued asking the jury to find that Smithfield Hog Production’s actions have caused a substantial and unreasonable interference in their ability to use and enjoy their properties.</p><p>So far, five cases have gone to trial in Raleigh.&nbsp; The juries in all five cases held Smithfield (which goes by the corporate name of Murphy-Brown) liable.&nbsp; The juries awarded the families money damages.&nbsp; However, the company has now appealed the verdicts.</p><p>On April 29, 2019, the families filed their brief with the Federal Court of Appeals.&nbsp; You can read it by clicking on the link below.&nbsp;</p><p>Scholars and nonprofit groups have also filed briefs.&nbsp; The most recent were filed on Monday, May 6.&nbsp; You can read each of those briefs by clicking on the links below.</p><p>The issues have extended beyond the courtroom.&nbsp; The company has lobbied the legislature to pass industry-friendly bills.&nbsp; The debate has played out in the public arena.&nbsp; The families have sought to publicize their side of the story.&nbsp;</p><p>The company knows that steps can be taken to remedy the problems.&nbsp; The pollution is estimated to add millions of dollars in costs to our healthcare system.&nbsp; And the affected counties are filled with open-air waste lagoons and contaminated soil.&nbsp; If the industry won’t bear the cost, it will ultimately fall on the citizens of North Carolina.</p><p><img style=\"width: 100%;" src=\"clientuploads/Blog_Images/Picture3.png" alt=\"hog waste pond\"></p><p>The company has tried to pit neighbor against neighbor and claim that the families are trying to put local farmers out of business.&nbsp; That is not true.&nbsp; The families did not make a claim against the farmers at trial.&nbsp; They only sought damages from Smithfield Hog Production, the company that owns all the hogs.&nbsp;</p><p>The families believe it is important not just to them, but to all of the citizens of North Carolina, that WH Group and Smithfield be required to take the necessary steps to ensure the long-term sustainability of the industry.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Wallace and Graham will continue to provide updates as these cases proceed.</p><p>LINKS:</p><ul class="list"><li><a href=\"clientuploads/PDF/19-1019_Brief_of_Appellee_-_doc_46.pdf" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">The Plaintiffs’ appeal brief.

  tag: 'In the News',
  blog: '<p><span>Last month, </span><a href=\"mona-lisa-wallace/\"><span>Wallace & Graham Partner Mona Lisa Wallace</span></a><span> had the opportunity to present to a room of female attorneys at the First Annual </span><a href=\"https://www.ncaj.com/\"><span>NCAJ</span></a><span> Women’s Caucus Retreat held in Winston-Salem at the historic Kimpton Cardinal Hotel. &nbsp;&nbsp;Mona Lisa was asked to speak on how to optimize a jury verdict for your client. She loved speaking to accomplished and new female attorneys about her experiences in the courtroom over her 40 years of practice. &nbsp;Below are the highlights of her guidance to these wonderful women: </span></p><h3><b>Prepare for Jury Selection&nbsp;</b></h3><p><b><span>The jurors are the most important people in the courtroom and the fate of your clients is in their hands. Annually, state courts conduct more than </span><a href=\"https://bit.ly/2Ke9J2Q\"><span>148,000 jury trials</span></a><span>, while federal courts conduct less than 6,000. &nbsp;About 1.5 million people end up serving on a jury--less than one percent of the adult population. &nbsp;</span></b></p><p><b><span>Your goal is to invite potential jurors to tell you how they feel and to expose any biases that they may have concerning the facts of your case. &nbsp;Depending on whether you are in state or federal court, some attorneys may be permitted to personally ask questions of jurors, or you may have to submit questions ahead of the trial for the judge to ask. &nbsp;You can win or lose cases for no reason other than juror bias. On average, jurors in a civil case take only about four hours to reach their verdict. </span></b></p><p><b><span>Your goal is to give them the information that they need to make their deliberations worthwhile and arrive at a just and fair result.</span></b></p><h3><b>Make Your Opening Your Roadmap</b></h3><p><b><span>Never underestimate the importance of your opening statement. &nbsp;It is the first opportunity the jury has to hear from you.&nbsp; It is immensely powerful to be able to say, with confidence, in the opening (or during your closing) at trial, that “I expect the Judge will be instructing you at the conclusion of this case,” and then quote or paraphrase what that instruction will be, and then explain to the jury how the evidence on your side of the case proves each of those elements. &nbsp;</span></b></p><p><b><span>The opening statement has to credibly educate the jury on what they will be asked to decide in order to allow them to know and to listen for what the evidence will show which is necessary to prove the elements of your case. In your opening, tell the jury what the other side will say. Predict for them some of the things they are going to hear from the defense attorney after you sit down. If there is a weakness in your case, share it. You do not want a shock to come later on at trial when the other side brings out a fact that you knew was coming but found no credible way to address.</span></b>&nbsp;</p><h3><b>Passion, Preparation, and Credibility</b></h3><p><b><span>If you do not believe in your client and the claim, then how can you expect the jury to believe in it? &nbsp;You must take a case for the right reasons and create the best opportunity for justice to prevail. The jury can quickly tell if you like your clients and if you are committed to and believe in their case.</span></b></p><p><b><span>Furthermore, you surely want to win (or lose) the case, knowing you have been honest and made your best effort. Be humble in your presentation of the evidence. Be obsessed with the facts, but do not exaggerate. &nbsp;There is no need to exaggerate what is true. Trying cases is hard and stressful. You must have the complete support of your family. Handling a significant case imposes a hardship not only on you and your office but most of all, on those you love the most. &nbsp;</span></b></p><p><b><span>You must discipline your schedule. You must have team members visit the courthouse ahead of time.&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to know the technology offered by the courtroom long before the trial begins.</span></b>&nbsp;</p><h3><b>You Cannot Do It Alone</b></h3><p><b><span>You may pride yourself on your own individual determination and ability. &nbsp;But in a significant matter, one person no matter how skilled will not be enough. &nbsp;You will need to have a team. It will need to be skilled and well-organized. You will need to have this team not only before trial but even more so during trial. &nbsp;</span></b></p><p><b><span>In order to succeed with representing claimants in litigation, you need friends and lots of them, and people working with you who believe in the case as much as you do. &nbsp;It is important to know when the scope of the case is such that you can handle it entirely in-house, versus when the nature of the matter is such that you should associate co-counsel. &nbsp;Never hesitate to associate co-counsel if it will benefit the client.</span></b></p><h3><b>Do Not Be Afraid of Losing</b></h3><p><b><i><span>“It is hard to fail, but it is worse never to have tried to succeed.” -- Theodore Roosevelt. &nbsp;</span></i></b></p><p><b><span>If a lawyer tells you she has never lost a case, you can be assured she is having a case of selective memory, or, she is not a lawyer you would want to recommend to a client in need of zealous representation. &nbsp;This is because the nature of the trial process is that it comes with a risk of loss. This is a matter of statistical reality, proven by many studies, and also, a matter of common sense. </span></b></p><p><b><span>Published papers and studies reflect that there is no way around it: &nbsp;the data regarding cases that go to trial reflects a very significant risk of loss for the plaintiff. However, this should not deter you from working hard and taking that risk when you have to do so.</span></b></p><h3><b>Expect and Plan for Surprises</b></h3><p><b><span>You should prepare, prepare, prepare, and overprepare because surprises will certainly be coming. &nbsp;My advice is, embrace that uncertainty, and learn to live with it. While so many litigators tend to be “control freaks,” the fact is that many factors at a trial will be out of your control. &nbsp;</span></b></p><p><b><span>The Judge may find that you rub her the wrong way; there might be a jury with a hidden bias; your key witness might grow flustered on the stand; any number of things could happen. Nonetheless, even knowing full well that your side may not obtain a verdict from the jury in its favor, there are times when you must go to trial. &nbsp;</span></b></p><p><b><span>Otherwise, you may not be able to fulfill your ethical duties to your client, and you certainly will not be able to maintain healthy credibility and keep the respect of the defense stakeholders for purposes of the settlement arena.</span></b></p><h3><b>Strategize the Order of the Presentation of Evidence</b></h3><p><b><span>You may think that your best witness is your client herself, the plaintiff. &nbsp;However, that is not always so, depending on the circumstances of the case. In a complicated medical case, for example, you may need to open the proceedings by calling your physician expert witness to educate the jury on the complex diagnostic or causation issues involved.</span></b></p><h3><b>Conclusion</b></h3><p><b><span>Trying a case is strategic and involves days, weeks, months, and often years of preparation, as well as significant personal sacrifices on the part of the lead counsel and their team. &nbsp;After the preparation is done, the most important thing left to do is to trust in yourself, your team, and your clients. Trust that your preparation and strategizing is enough, and have confidence in yourself as a litigator. &nbsp;Feel proud when your case is in the jury’s hands, and at that point, trust in your jury to give your client a fair verdict. </span></b></p><p><b><span>Do not forget to be humble and thankful to all those who helped you along the way, and to be easy on yourself for rulings or verdicts that do not go your way. &nbsp;Every tried case offers you a valuable learning experience. Do not be afraid to get out there and see what you can do with help, passion, and hard work.</span></b></p><p><span>I wish you the best of luck. &nbsp;Thank you for letting me share these tips with you. &nbsp;</span></p>'

Find a Qualified Doctor </b></h3><p><span>If you have been diagnosed with mesothelioma, the best thing you can do is find a qualified doctor that specializes in helping patients with that particularly cancer so that he/she can offer you the best treatment possible. &nbsp;There are some choices for patients who have this form of cancer, depending on the severity of it and where it is located. Most cases are found in the lungs, but it can also attack other organs of the body, including the heart. With that in mind, your first step after diagnosis is to find and talk to a qualified doctor about what kind of plan they might have for your treatment and your needs.

New Options Are Becoming Available for Patients</b></h3><p><span>Some newer treatments for mesothelioma are giving patients hope for the future. While these treatments are not always available to everyone, they are offering options for some people with the condition. Talking to your doctor about newer and even more experimental treatments can be worthwhile, depending on how advanced your condition is and what other treatment choices you have for your particular mesothelioma case. If you work with a team of professionals, the odds of extending your lifespan can be raised and your quality of life may be able to be improved, as well.</span></p><p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><h3><b>3. Consider Your History of Exposure to Asbestos</b></h3><p><span>If you have been diagnosed with mesothelioma, the odds are that you were exposed to asbestos. &nbsp;Some people may have been exposed to asbestos in their homes; however, many discovery they were exposed to asbestos at their work.</span></p><p><span>Workers diagnosed with mesothelioma have brought lawsuits against their employers, the manufacturers of the asbestos products, and the sites where the asbestos was located. &nbsp;Many companies knew that asbestos was dangerous but did little or nothing to protect those workers exposed. The initial lawsuits served as warnings to the asbestos companies, and afterwards there is much evidence that they tried to cover up the health effects of asbestos. </span><span>&nbsp;</span></p><p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><h3><b>4.

Some levels of exposure are larger than others, and someone who was immersed in an industry that used asbestos all the time would have a statistically greater risk of problems from that exposure than someone who was rarely around the substance. In addition, the family members and friends of people who worked in asbestos-heavy industries are also at risk.</span></p><p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><h3><b>Consider Whether the Exposure Was One-Time or Longer-Term</b></h3><p><span>While one-time exposure to asbestos can cause an asbestos-related disease or cancer, one-time exposure would be less likely to cause problems than a longer-term, repeated exposure. If you have been exposed to asbestos, take careful consideration of the level of exposure you have had, so you can better address any concerns that might come from that exposure. Mesothelioma Awareness Day was developed to provide increased awareness and information about the disease and exposure to asbestos.</span></p><p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><h3><b>Work With a Doctor to Address the Risk</b></h3><p><span>Working with your doctor to </span><span>address your risk level</span><span> is also important because that can start the process of monitoring your health to determine whether you are developing a problem like mesothelioma. There are also other kinds of lung diseases that can be acquired from asbestos exposure, so one of the keys to protecting your long-term health is to find a doctor who is familiar with these types of problems. Then they can better address your exposure levels, and help you focus on the kinds of issues that may be legitimate while easing your fears in other areas. </span></p><p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><h3><b>Talk With an <a href=\"mesothelioma-asbestosis\">Attorney Who Handles Mesothelioma Cases</a></b></h3><p><span>If you or a loved one have been exposed to asbestos and you do develop mesothelioma, talking to a </span><a href=\"mesothelioma-asbestosis\"><span>mesothelioma lawyer</span></a><span> about your condition is very important. In many cases, compensation is available for people with the disease, and for families of loved ones who have passed away from the disease. Your particular level of exposure to asbestos, how long ago it has been, what kinds of treatments you have considered, and other factors can all affect compensation levels.</span></p><p><span>Each case is unique, and by working with an attorney who handles mesothelioma cases you can have a higher chance of receiving proper compensation for the harm that asbestos exposure has caused you and your family and loved ones.</span></p><h3>Learn How to <a href=\"prevent-mesothelioma\">Prevent Mesothelioma</a></h3>'

  blog: '<p>This is a re-post of an article, "Sales of Essure birth control implant to be halted by Bayer; U.S. last to sell controversial device" published by the Washington Post on July 20, 2018.&nbsp; Written by&nbsp;<a class=\"author-name" href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/laurie-mcginley/\">Laurie McGinley</a></p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">"Pharmaceutical giant Bayer said Friday that it will halt sales of its controversial Essure birth-control device in the United States at the end of the year, bringing to a close a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/sf/style/2017/07/26/essure/?tid=a_inl_manual&utm_term=.59cbd78e7030\">protracted battle</a>&nbsp;over an implant that thousands of women blame for serious health problems, including persistent pain and perforations of the uterus and fallopian tubes.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;" data-elm-loc="2\">The company said Essure&apos;s removal from the market was "business decision" prompted by precipitous declines in sales in recent years. It said in a statement that it stands by the safety and effectiveness of the device, and added that women who currently have Essure in place can continue to “confidently” rely on it.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;" data-elm-loc="3\">The United States is the last country where Essure is being sold. Last September, citing "commercial reasons,” Bayer announced it was ending sales outside the United States.</p><div class=\"teads-inread sm-screen" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"><div class=\"teads-ui-components-adchoices" style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Essure, which is designed to cause sterilization, consists of&nbsp;two inch-long, flexible coils made in part from an alloy of nickel and titanium. In a procedure that takes about 10 minutes, a doctor inserts the coils through&nbsp;the vagina and cervix and into the fallopian tubes, which carry eggs from the ovaries to the uterus. Over three months, scar tissue is supposed to form around the coils, creating a barrier that keeps sperm from reaching the eggs.</div></div><p style=\"padding-left: 60px;" data-elm-loc="5\">In recent years, thousands of women have reported complications including autoimmune problems, unintended pregnancies and the migration of the coils into the pelvis or abdomen. Many said the problems were so severe that they had the devices surgically removed. Bayer has been served with lawsuits representing more than 16,000 patients, the company said earlier this year.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60px;" data-elm-loc="6\">Angie Firmalino, one of the leaders of the fight against the device, on Friday said she was "blown away" by Bayer&apos;s announcement. "It took way too long, but we won," said the 46-year-old mail carrier from Tannersville, N.Y.</p><div id="google_ads_iframe_/701/wpni.national/health-science/blog/to-your-health_5__container__" style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">Firmalino said she had the device inserted in 2009 and almost immediately began having pain and bleeding; she eventually learned that the coils had migrated to her uterus and had a hysterectomy. In 2011, she started the Facebook group “Essure Problems,” which has&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/fda-to-review-safety-of-controversial-womens-sterilization-device/2015/09/21/472aecb2-5b20-11e5-8e9e-dce8a2a2a679_story.html?utm_term=.1ca80ec6a889\">waged a social media campaign</a>&nbsp;against the device and pressed the Food and Drug Administration to ban it. The group has 37,000 members.</div><p style=\"padding-left: 60px;" data-elm-loc="8\">Bayer said Essure sales in the United States have plummeted by about 40 percent a year in recent years. On Friday, the company attributed the decrease to several factors: a decline in the number of women using permanent contraception; increased reliance on long-acting contraceptives that are reversible, such as intrauterine devices, and “inaccurate and misleading publicity” about the implant.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60px;" data-elm-loc="9\">The device, which was approved by the FDA in 2002, was initially hailed as a nonsurgical alternative to tubal ligation, commonly called having one&apos;s “tubes tied.” It was developed by Conceptus Inc., a California medical products manufacturer that Bayer acquired in 2013.</p><div id="google_ads_iframe_/701/wpni.national/health-science/blog/to-your-health_7__container__" style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">As reports of complications have mounted over the years, the FDA has consistently maintained, as Bayer has, that the device&apos;s benefits outweigh its risks. But the agency also has acknowledged that there have been serious problems associated with the contraceptive and ordered up additional warnings and safety studies.</div><p style=\"padding-left: 60px;" data-elm-loc="11\">In 2016, for example,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2016/02/29/fda-requires-black-box-warning-but-leaves-controversial-essure-implant-on-market/?utm_term=.43a372ccc840\">the FDA required Bayer to add a “black box”</a>&nbsp;— the agency&apos;s most serious warning — to the product&apos;s label. And it directed Bayer to create a three-page checklist for doctors to use in discussing potential problems with patients before implantation."</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;" data-elm-loc="11\"><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/to-your-health/wp/2018/07/20/sales-of-essure-birth-control-implant-halted-by-bayer-u-s-was-last-to-sell-controversial-device/?noredirect=on&utm_term=.b554df7b2ec8" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">Finish reading the full article on WashingtonPost.com</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;find out if you have legal recourse against Essure.&nbsp;</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;" data-elm-loc="11\">&nbsp;</p>'

  blog: '<h3>How Do You Get Mesothelioma?</h3><h3>Mesothelioma is a Type of Cancer</h3><p>Mesothelioma is a cancer of the thin lining surrounding the lung (pleural membrane) or abdominal cavity (the peritoneum). Mesothelioma is caused by exposure to asbestos or asbestos-containing products. Cancer from asbestos does not develop immediately but shows up after a number of years. Studies of workers also suggest that breathing asbestos can increase chances of getting cancer in other parts of the body (stomach, intestines, esophagus, pancreas, and kidneys). Early identification and treatment of any cancer can increase an individual&apos;s quality of life and survival. &nbsp;</p><p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><h3>Asbestos is a Dangerous Substance</h3><p><span>For many years, </span>&gt;<span>asbestos was used as an insulation</span><span> for homes, buildings, and in manufacturing products and processes. It went into walls, pipes were wrapped with it, and systems were protected by it. Anytime asbestos is displaced, the fibers can get into the air. Asbestos dust and fibers can be pulled into the lungs through normal breathing. &nbsp;The particles can be so tiny that masks do not protect against them. </span></p><p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><h3>Mesothelioma Can Be Prevented</h3><p><span>While there are instances where someone could have exposure to asbestos without their knowledge, most cases of mesothelioma can easily be eliminated by removing asbestos from buildings, homes, and the workplace and with the </span><a href=\"https://www.maacenter.org/blog/get-involved-on-mesothelioma-awareness-day/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\"><span>proper safety precautions</span></a><span>. If asbestos is removed unsafely, it can cause more harm than leaving it undisturbed. For anyone who works in industries where asbestos was used, it is very important to ensure that asbestos is no longer part of the industry and that any asbestos left behind is remediated following approved methods. That diligence can help prevent cases of mesothelioma in workers and their families.</span></p><h3>Mesothelioma Can Develop Many Years After Exposure</h3><p><span>Mesothelioma is a cancer that typically has a “latency” period in the body for development. &nbsp;This means that for many exposed to asbestos in the past, mesothelioma will develop and be diagnosed in the future, not immediately upon exposure. This is also true for the spouses and children of people who worked with asbestos years ago. Workers brought fibers home on their clothing, which exposed their family to the risks of mesothelioma. Sometimes taking up to 50 years to develop, mesothelioma can be eliminated for future generations by no longer using asbestos and by making sure existing asbestos is properly remediated.</span></p><p><strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong></strong></p><h3>Developing Mesothelioma Can Mean Needing a Good Attorney</h3><p><span>Workers diagnosed with mesothelioma have brought lawsuits against their employers, the manufacturers of the asbestos products, and the sites where the asbestos was located. &nbsp;Many companies knew that asbestos was dangerous but did little or nothing to protect those workers exposed. The initial lawsuits served as warnings to the asbestos companies, and afterwards, there is much evidence that they tried to cover up the health effects of asbestos. </span><span>&nbsp;</span>The <a href=\"https://www.usmesotheliomalaw.com/" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">law firm of Wallace & Graham</a> <span>has many years of experience in helping employees who have been injured by occupational exposure to asbestos.

No one wants to ever get to that point, but if they do, a lawyer is a good ally to have on your side. This guide provides some information on personal injury law.</p><h3><strong>Personal injury lawyer definition</strong></h3><p>Also known as a trial lawyer or plaintiff lawyer, a personal injury attorney is a civil litigator who represents people who have sustained physical or psychological loss or injury because of someone else’s careless or negligent actions. The other party may be an individual, corporation, or organization. The personal injury lawyer job description involves giving legal advice, filing legal complaints, preparing legal documents, and representing his or her client in court or during legal proceedings.</p><p>One of the best-known examples of <a href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/personal-injury-car-motorcycle-trucking-accidents\">personal injury is the car accident</a>. However, other examples include medical malpractice, slip and fall incidents, and product defects. Some cases, like assault claims can be tried in criminal court as well as civil. On the civil side, it is considered a personal injury case.</p><h3><strong>Is it worth hiring a personal injury attorney?</strong></h3><p>If you have been in an accident or are filing a lawsuit against someone to get compensation for injuries or loss, you have your best chance at getting full compensation if you hire a personal injury attorney. Most of the time, when a person tried to handle their case on their own, they wind up negotiating a settlement with the insurance agency – who then gives them a lowball offer. The person accepts because they don’t know that they can do better. Letting a personal injury attorney handle the case usually results in full compensation for the plaintiff.</p><h3><strong>How to find a personal injury lawyer</strong></h3><p>A simple internet search will give you the names of several personal injury lawyers in your area. However, if you may want to ask your family or friends if they have had any experience with attorneys and see if they have any recommendations. Review sites like Yelp and AVVO can also give you attorney ratings and reviews.

Reynolds Tobacco, Lorillard, and Phillip Morris USA popping up in print&nbsp;and broadcast. These ads mark another victory against the deceptive practices of cigarette makers, and health organization, advocacy groups, and their supporters see the new cigarette ads to be one more step towards these manufactures telling the truth about the role they played in deceiving the public about the deadly impact of smoking. The cigarette ads, which began appearing this week, are the result of a 2006 federal case that found cigarette makers guilty of violating racketeering laws. As part of the ruling in that federal case, a court-order requiring cigarette manufacturers to place “corrective statement” advertisements in print publications, on network television, the internet, and other locations where cigarettes are sold. The court order requires that cigarette manufacturers place these “corrective statement” advertisements throughout mainstream media, requiring that newspaper and print ads run until April 2018 and on cable and network television during primetime broadcasts for 52 weeks, beginning November 27. The message from the American Cancer Society the, "Truth Will Come Out” a hope held by all of the public health groups and advocates is that Big Tobacco will be finally be held accountable for the industries decades of misinformation and lies told to consumers by cigarette manufacture. &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Here are some examples of Big tobacco ads from the past: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; To view more of the&nbsp;court-ordered Big Tobacco television ads/corrective statements and print advertisements by visiting the <a href=\"https://www.acscan.org\">American&nbsp;Cancer Society</a> website, listed below. <a href=\"https://www.acscan.org/big-tobacco-television-ads\">American Cancer Society; Link to new advertisements;</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.acscan.org/big-tobacco-television-ads\">[embed]https://www.youtube.com/embed/vwLchpP4Z20[/embed]</a></p><p><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">SOURCES</span></strong> <a href=\"https://www.nbcnews.com/health/health-News/big-tobacco-finally-tells-truth-court-ordered-ad-campaign-n823136\">Big Tobacco finally tells the truth in court-ordered ad campaign, NBC News, November 2017</a> <a href=\"https://pressroom.cancer.org/correctivestatement2017\">Tobacco Companies Must Run Court-Ordered Ads; Statement of the American Cancer Society and other groups, the American Cancer Society</a>, &nbsp;</p>'

This issue will not occur if a seat is properly latched.” Honda has provided owners of the effected 2011 to 2017 models of the Honda Odyssey Minivan with instructions on what to do ensure that the seats are properly secured.

  title: 'After OSHA Investigation and Fines for inappropriate handling of Asbestos, Davidson County Commissioners vote to take a Proactive Approach',

  desc: 'The survey, costing the county $42,000, will evaluate the facilities, locate, and describe the condition of any materials that could potentially contain asbestos.',
  tag: 'Asbestosis & Mesothelioma',
  blog: '<p>On October 10, 2017, the Davidson County Board of Commissioners unanimously approved a proposal from TrinityEnvironmental to conduct comprehensive asbestos surveys on 38 facilities around Davidson County. The survey, costing the county $42,000, will evaluate the facilities, locate, and describe the condition of any materials that could potentially contain asbestos. The company will then advise the county and provide training related to safely maintaining buildings with asbestos-containing materials. The approval comes less than two months after OSHA fined the county for potentially exposing county employees and members of the public to asbestos fibers at the Davidson County Courthouse. (SEE OSHA Finding below). Asbestos is a fiber that when inhaled can lead to a number of health issues. The dangers related to asbestos have been known for many decades. Exposure to asbestos has been linked to a number of respiratory issues, including mesothelioma and various other cancers. Inhaling asbestos fibers is the only known cause of mesothelioma, a deadly cancer that attacks the lining of the lungs. According to OSHA documents, the investigation related to the handling of asbestos at the Davidson County Courthouse began after the agency received a complaint about how asbestos-containing materials were being handled during construction and maintenance projects at the courthouse. <a href=\"https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/establishment.inspection_detail?id=1242193.01\">[1]</a> While investigating the complaint, OSHA investigators found three violations related to poor management of the asbestos issues at the courthouse. Those findings resulted in three citations and $6,500 in fines. Davidson County has contested the findings, and in a press release pointed out that the “OSHA inspection revealed no current health or safety issues in the courthouse, but found violations concerning asbestos management.” [County: No current health concerns at the courthouse. <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2LRRP9m\">[2]</a> This is a “proactive strategy” according to Davidson County’s assistant manager Casey Smith. He explained that the survey will inspect buildings that are 35 or more years old. These buildings, like many others across the country built prior to the 1980s, were likely constructed with materials that contained asbestos. Going forward, this approach will give Davidson County officials the information that they need to ensure the safety of employees and citizens that use county facilities, like the courthouse, but some worry that the damage has already been done. Davidson County Clerk of Superior Court, Brian Shipwash, has been very vocal about the asbestos issues at the Davidson County Courthouse. In fact, Shipwash has repeatedly said that he is the person who made the complaint to OSHA about potential asbestos exposure at the courthouse after a worker complained to him. While Shipwash is glad to see the proactive approach that the county commissioners have decided to take, he is also worried about the lack of precautions that were taken over the years. Shipwash said he could recall a number of projects that he had witnessed in his 19 years of working at the courthouse that disregarded the dangers of asbestos-containing materials, adding that the county had been notified of the asbestos hazard in 2015. Shipwash went on to explain that he is concerned for his staff, the county employees tasks, even citizens who come into the courthouse. Stating that due to the county’s lack of asbestos management, they all could have “potentially been exposed to airborne asbestos due to their [Davidson County’s] failure to properly treat this building as such in the many projects that they [the county] have done” <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2K9LKSg\">[3]</a> Shipwash, like many others working and conducting business at the Davidson County Courthouse, want to know that the county is following all the federal and state rules and procedures for handling materials that contain asbestos. After all, those rules and procedures were created to keep people safe from the harmful effects that can be caused by asbestos. REVIEW: VIOLATIONS FOUND BY OSHA FOLLOWING INSPECTION OF DAVIDSON COUNTY COURTHOUSE (August 2017) [Inspection: 1242193.015 - 134918 - Davidson County Courthouse - Clerk of Courts https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/establishment.inspection_detail?id=1242193.015</p><ul class="list"><li>The Davidson County Government failed to inform building tenants/employees of the Davidson County Courthouse regarding the presence, location, and quantity of asbestos-containing material or presumed asbestos contain material. In addition, the same citation noted that the County had not informed the building occupants of who would be performing work within adjacent areas of the presence, location, and quantity of asbestos.</li></ul><ul class="list"><li>Davidson County did not ensure that a competent person conducted an exposure assessment immediately before or at the initiation of the operation to ascertain expected exposures during that operation or workplace. The County performed Class III asbestos work and an exposure assessment was never performed. This could mean that many were exposed to the toxin.</li></ul><ul class="list"><li>Davidson County performed Class III asbestos work without using engineering and work practice controls that minimize the exposure to employees performing the asbestos work and to bystander employees. The county failed to use wet methods, local exhaust ventilation, impermeable drop cloths, mini-enclosures, glove bag systems, and or plastic barriers. Again, the failure to follow proven methods that limit or eliminate exposure means that anyone in the courthouse at the time of asbestos-related work could have been exposed.</li></ul><p>SOURCES <span style=\"color: #000000;\">[1]<a style=\"color: #000000;" href=\"https://www.osha.gov/pls/imis/establishment.inspection_detail?id=1242193.015\"> Inspection: 1242193.015 - 134918 - Davidson County Courthouse - Clerk of Courts</a></span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;" href=\"https://bit.ly/2LRRP9m\">[2] County: NO Current Health Concerns at Courthouse, Lexington Dispatch, August 16, 2017</a></span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">[3] <a style=\"color: #000000;" href=\"https://bit.ly/2K9LKSg\">OSHA fines county for asbestos issues in </a>courthouse<a style=\"color: #000000;" href=\"https://bit.ly/2K9LKSg\">, The Lexington Dispatch, Aug. 15, 2017.&nbsp;</a></span> <span style=\"color: #000000;\">[4]&nbsp;County Approves Asbestos Survey, Lexington Dispatch, October 10, 2017.</span> &nbsp;</p>'

  blog: '<p><strong>A Nationwide Voluntary Recall was issued for EpiPen and EpiPen, Jr. on March 31, 2017.</strong> On March 31, 2017, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm550170.htm" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\"> Nationwide Voluntary Recall had been issued for EpiPen and EpiPen, Jr.</a> The Nationwide Voluntary Recall was issued by the drugs manufacturer MYLAN, due to a potential defect that could cause the device to be infective, leading to a failure that would prevent the appropriate delivery of the lifesaving medication to a patient that is having a severe allergic reaction. The failure of an EpiPen or EpiPen, Jr. as described in the recall could result in serious injury or death for a patient having a severe allergic reaction. This current recall is being conducted as a result of the receipt of two previously disclosed reports outside of the U.S. of the device failing to activate due to a potential defect in a supplier component. The potential defect could make the device difficult to activate in an emergency (failure to activate or increased force needed to activate) and have significant health consequences for a patient experiencing a life-threatening allergic reaction (anaphylaxis). Both reports are related to the single lot that was previously recalled. The incidence of the defect is extremely rare and testing and analysis across the potentially impacted lots has not identified any units with a defect. However, the recall is being expanded to include additional lots as a precautionary measure out of an abundance of caution. EpiPen or EpiPen, Jr., are devices that deliver a dose of the lifesaving medication, epinephrine to patients experiencing a severe allergic reaction. In September 2017,<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/ICECI/EnforcementActions/WarningLetters/2017/ucm574981.htm" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\"> the FDA sent a letter</a> to the manufacturing facility that Mylan utilizes to produce the EpiPen or EpiPen, Jr., expressing a number of concerns, with the most alarming being that after receiving “hundreds of complaints” the company failed to investigate the potential for a deadly defect in the product. Furthermore, the letter questions why, after defective devices were linked to patient deaths the company took no actions to investigate or correct issues related to the potential for failure of the devices until the FDA began investigations. In addition to this Nationwide Voluntary Recall, Mylan issued another recall of EpiPens earlier this year. That recall impacted more than 20 lots of EpiPens. Mylan has also come under fire for increasing the price of the EpiPen. The price for the EpiPen has increased more than 400% in recent years. The company has also been investigated by the U.S. Justice Department for overcharging the government that ended with Mylan entering into a $465 million settlement with the agency. For many, this has caused great concerns related to the safety and effectiveness of the products.&nbsp;If you are one of the thousands of people that have been prescribed or that stock EpiPen or EpiPen, Jr. in your emergency medical kit, please check the recalled lot information listed below. If you or your family member has had an issue when using an EpiPen or EpiPen, Jr., that may have caused further health complications,<a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/safety/medwatch/howtoreport/ucm053074.htm" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\"> it is important to report those issues to the FDA</a>. If you or a family member used an EpiPen or EpiPen, Jr., and experienced a failure of the device to function properly, resulting in additional health complications or death, those claims should be investigated. The attorneys at <em>Wallace & Graham, P.A.</em> are here to assist you, and investigate your claim.

  blog: '<p>After 3-Alarm Fire at Dow Chemical Plant in Northeast Charlotte, questions are being asked about the safety of the workers and those living near the location. The Dow Chemical Co. plant located on the 6100 block of Orr Road in east Charlotte was the site of a three-alarm fire on Wednesday morning (Sept. 27th). A spokesperson from Dow Chemical Co., told local news outlets that the fire was the result of a chemical reaction in a drum that contained a chemical.” Following an investigation by the Charlotte Fire Department Investigation Task Force, the chemical source of the fire was identified as divinylbenzene (DVB). Divinylbenzene (DVB) is a highly reactive chemical compound, with a high risk of fire and explosion if improperly handled. The explosive potential of the chemical showed its self after a holding drum became over-pressurized, resulting in Wednesday’s morning blaze. Fire investigators were able to determine that a thermal reaction that occurred in a storage drum housed outside the plant, occurred leading to the fire. The fire was contained to the outside of the facility. In addition to being classified as a fire and explosion hazard, divinylbenzene (DVB) has been linked to a number of health issues. A short period of exposure to divinylbenzene (DVB) can cause respiratory issues if inhaled and irritation to the skin and eyes. Those that have experienced long periods of exposure to divinylbenzene (DVB) are at a high risk of developing health issues related to exposures to benzene and benzene containing products, including serious health issues, including cancers. This realization has neighbors close to the Dow Chemical Co. location on Orr Rd worried about their safety, and following an investigation by local news channel wsoctv.com, in Charlotte revealed that Dow Chemical has a history of lax safety practices. According to the WSOCTV report, the Dow Chemical Co. has been cited by the U.S. Department of Labor 28 times in February 2017 for the control of hazardous energy, overhead and gantry cranes, and safety management of highly hazardous chemicals. This realization has local residents are even more concerned about the safety practices at this Dow Chemical Co. location. <a href=\"https://www.wsoctv.com/News/local/long-list-of-violations-at-charlotte-chemical-plant-uncovered-after-fire/615525439\">Long list of violations at Charlotte chemical plant uncovered after fire; WSOCTV.COM&nbsp;</a> <a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/News/local/article175612036.html\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">Fire breaks out at east Charlotte chemical company, The Charlotte Observer;</span></a><a href=\"https://www.charlotteobserver.com/News/local/article175612036.html\"><span style=\"color: #000000;\">&nbsp;</span>&nbsp;www.charlotteobserver.com/</a></p>'

Brockovich became well-known for her consumer and environmental advocacy work, following a movie from 2000 based on her experience working as a legal clerk, collecting evidence about water contamination that had sickened the residents of Hinkley, CA. In the last 20 years, she has repeatedly spoken out against known corporate polluters. Because of the film, groups fighting to protect their communities from corporations that are known environmental polluter often contact Brockovich. Most recently, she has joined with residents of her home state of Kansas to oppose the opening of a Tyson Foods Poultry Facility. Over the weekend, Brockovich spoke out on behalf of the residents in Tonganoxie, Kansas, a location not too far from her own hometown -- Lawrence, Kansas -- that are opposing the opening of a Tyson Foods poultry plant in the community. On Sept. 7th, Brockovich took to social media to speak out against the proposed poultry facility. In the posting directed to Tyson Foods via her Facebook page, Brockovich acknowledges the many residents of Tonganoxie that had reached out to her for help, going on to call out Tyson Food Inc. for their history of polluting the nation&apos;s waterways. In the post, she directly addresses Tyson Foods, saying to the company, <em>"Clean up your act if you want respect. Get off the list of our nation&apos;s biggest polluters and then come talk to us. Until then, you cannot continue to grow on the backs of the people.”</em> <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ErinBrockovichOfficial/?hc_ref=ARTlWJ_RlDLP4lstRQQq4akwH7kp4EjD6kFVgrpZQukbHqY-t2CiePfXdogeMt9N3Vw&fref=nf" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">(Link to Erin Brockovich FB post/Page)</a> Considering her stance on protecting the environment, and Tyson Foods Inc.’s history of pollution, it is no surprise that Erin Brockovich joined the community’s efforts by speaking out against a proposed Tyson Foods poultry operation. As Brockovich pointed out in her post, Tyson Foods is responsible for dumping into the more than 18 million pounds of toxic chemicals into the nation’s waterway annually. This point is driven home further by the most current data that Tyson Foods submitted on its own behalf to the <a href=\"https://www.epa.gov" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (US EPA’s)</a> Toxic Release Inventory. <em>According to that data, Tyson Foods Inc. was the 2nd biggest polluter of America’s waterways from 2010 to 2014, trailing behind AK Steel Holding Corp., who holds1st&nbsp;place as the biggest polluter of the country’s waterways. As pointed out by Brockovich, this means, “Tyson Foods and its subsidiaries’ processing plants dumped more than 104 million pounds of pollutants into waterways over those five years – more than Cargill Inc., Koch Industries Inc., and ExxonMobil Corporation combined.”</em> Supporters of the new facility, including a representative of Tyson Foods Inc., and local government officials have down played the company’s history as a major source of waterway pollution. Instead,&nbsp;supports are pointing to the benefits the new facility will bring to the community, which according to Kansas news KCTV, those that support the Tyson plant say it will bring 1,600 jobs to the area and help to improve the area’s economy to the tune of $150 million. While the local citizens and government officials consider the fate of the Tyson operation it may be a good idea to take into account the cost to clean-up any sites that are contaminated by the operation. Considering that Tyson Foods Inc. has a history of waterway pollution, the cost of cleaning up (which seems inevitable) could far outweigh any potential benefits for the community as a whole. <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ErinBrockovichOfficial/?hc_ref=ARTlWJ_RlDLP4lstRQQq4akwH7kp4EjD6kFVgrpZQukbHqY-t2CiePfXdogeMt9N3Vw&fref=nf\">Erin Brockovich</a></p><blockquote><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ErinBrockovichOfficial/posts/10159308017190494\">September 7 at 7:41pm</a>&nbsp;· My inbox is full of requests from the good people of Tonganoxie, Kansas asking for my help fighting a massive chicken processing plant in their community.

I was born and raised in Kansas... now living in California... where I too have been receiving pollution and environmental complaints about Tyson Foods for over a decade. I base my involvement on these matters based on a company&apos;s current record... so here is a fun fact for Kansas Governor Brownback: Tyson Foods Inc. was the second biggest polluter of America’s waterways from 2010 to 2014, according to the most current data the company submitted to the United States Environmental Protection Agency’s (USEPA’s) Toxic Release Inventory. Ranking only behind AK Steel Holding Corp, Tyson Foods and its subsidiaries’ processing plants dumped more than 104 million pounds of pollutants into waterways over those five years – more than Cargill Inc., Koch Industries Inc., and ExxonMobil Corporation combined. Doug Ramsey, an official with Tyson Foods, lied about the company&apos;s record of pollution and waste discharges... then demanded respect... sorry Mr. Ramsey, but I don&apos;t respect a talking head from our nations biggest polluters that do in fact shit where they eat.

  title: 'Class Action Lawsuit Settlement  in favor of Military Families signals to  Senate that they need to Support the CFPB Rule to protect consumers',

  desc: 'According to the SCRA, when a service member is called to active service status by the military, the banks are required to reduce the interest rates on those debts owed to a 6% interest rate – according to military families taking part in this class action, Bank of America failed to comply with that law.',
  blog: '<p>Our firm is pleased to report a recent settlement in July 2017 between Bank of America and military families. &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The plaintiffs in the class actions consisted of a group of military families, on active duty service and deployments, who were overcharged and deceived by Bank of America. The 130,000 military families that took part in the class action against Bank of America reached a settlement of nearly $30 million. The lawsuit was filed after Bank of America failed to follow the Service members Civil Relief Act or SCRA, a law passed by Congress in 2003 to reduce the burden faced by military families. According to the SCRA, when a service member is called to active service status by the military, the banks are required to reduce the interest rates on those debts owed to a 6% interest rate – according to military families taking part in this class action, Bank of America failed to comply with that law. Instead, Bank of America failed to apply the required interest rate reduction and then sent deceptive monthly statements that suggested the reduction had been applied, when in-fact Bank of America had been charging a much higher interest rate, sometimes as high as 27%. The result of Bank of America’s deceptive actions, some active service members lost their homes and most valuable assets. A North Carolina federal court ruled in favor of the military family members, and the settlement of nearly $30 million will be distributed among them, using calculations based on accounts records supplied by Bank of America to determine the amounts owed to each family. The amount owed to each of the families will be determined using calculations based on the records supplied by Bank of America, and the funds will be distributed accordingly. This case is unusual because most banks and large financial institutions include language in consumer contracts that prevent consumers from file lawsuits to seek justice when they have a dispute or feel as if they have been cheated or deceived by such an institution. This language can usually be found the section of a contract that discusses the rights of each the parties to the contract, called an arbitration clause, or arbitration provision. Most consumer banking and financial institution contract include an arbitration provision. Generally, an arbitration provision requires that if a dispute occurs, all parties to the contract agree to consent to arbitration to resolve that dispute. Arbitration is a private process that does not include a jury as the decision-maker. In addition to the arbitration provision, some contracts even have a provision that bans participation in class action lawsuits, like the one filed by military families in North Carolina. Our firm also encourages consumers to be wary of both arbitration agreements and class action bans when entering into a contract, because they disallow a group of people that have cases with facts almost identical that suffered similar injury, from pursuing relief as a group. Our firm joins other law firms and public interest organizations like Public Justice – a national nonprofit consumer protection law organization – in pointing out that the reason military families were able to have their day in court against Bank of America was made possible by Bank of America not having an arbitration clause in its contract. As of July 2017, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), an agency of the United States government responsible for consumer protection in the financial sector, has been working to protect consumers from the injustice that consumers suffer because of practices like forced arbitration and the banning of class action lawsuits. In July the CFPB, issued a rule that prohibits banks and payday lenders from using arbitration clause. The prohibition of arbitration provisions in banking and payday lending contracts allows for individuals to band together to file a class action lawsuit, pooling their resources together, instead of being forced to fight against a Goliath organization, like Big Banking, on an individual or case-by-case basis. By issuing a prohibition against arbitration clauses, the CFPB has offered consumers a new avenue of protection from potential exploitation – and fleecing at the hand of unscrupulous banks and lenders. In the coming weeks, Senate will be making decisions about the enforcement of consumer protection laws. If they decide to revoke the ability of the CFPB to make rules, like the prohibition of the arbitration provision, Senate will be protecting the pockets of Big Business and Big Banking, and not acting in the best interest of the general public.</p>'

  tag: 'Class Actions & Consumer Rights',
  blog: '<p><em><strong>DATA BREACH AT THE CONSUMER CREDIT REPORTING AGENCY, EQUIFAX HAS EXPOSES THE DATA OF NEARLY 1/2 THE AMERICAN POPULATION.</strong></em> On Thursday, Equifax announced that the personal information of 143 million Americans -- almost ½ the U.S. population -- has been compromised after a data breach that exposed sensitive information including social security numbers, driver’s license numbers, and address information. The company said it also appears that credit card numbers and other sensitive credit related information were also exposed for at least a portion of those impacted by the breach. Equifax is one of the “Big Three” consumer credit reporting agencies, a title shared with Experian and TransUnion. These companies specialize in collecting and selling consumer credit and insurance information, and related analytic data to other business in various industries. The information provided by Equifax and other consumer credit reporting agencies in then utilized by the purchasing business to determine financial status make credit and insurance related decision, and to evaluate risk related to the consumers documented behaviors. Equifax has taken measures to inform the public and the media of the breach, including a video statement issued by the company’s chair and CEO Richard F. Smith. In that statement, Smith expressed his “disappointment” over the breach, which was discovered on July 29, and was not made public until yesterday. In addition, as a response to the need to inform consumers impacted by the data breach, Equifax has created a data breach website. According to the company, consumers can check to see if they are one of the 143 million consumers whose data has been impacted. <a href=\"https://www.equifaxsecurity2017.com/consumer-notice/\">LINK TO Cybersecurity Incident & Important Consumer Information</a> Since the announcement yesterday, media outlets have directed consumers to the data breach help site step-up by Equifax. While the site has experienced some technical difficulties, Equifax has asked consumers to continue to try the site if they encounter issues. For those that have been able to access the site, they warn to READ THE FINE PRINT. According to a report in the Washington Post, the website&apos;s terms of service includes legal language that limits consumers&apos; ability to participate in any class action that may arise from the breach. This is often called an “arbitration clause,” which is meant to cut down on the number of cases moving through the court system, but in reality can strip consumers ability to seek justice when the actions of a large company, like Equifax, has caused them harm. So as you are checking to see if your personal information was exposed in the Equifax fax data breach, make sure you read the fine print in the Equifax data websites terms of service:</p><blockquote>AGREEMENT TO RESOLVE ALL DISPUTES BY BINDING INDIVIDUAL ARBITRATION. PLEASE READ THIS ENTIRE SECTION CAREFULLY BECAUSE IT AFFECTS YOUR LEGAL RIGHTS BY REQUIRING ARBITRATION OF DISPUTES (EXCEPT AS SET FORTH BELOW) AND A WAIVER OF THE ABILITY TO BRING OR PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION, CLASS ARBITRATION, OR OTHER REPRESENTATIVE ACTION. ARBITRATION PROVIDES A QUICK AND COST EFFECTIVE MECHANISM FOR RESOLVING DISPUTES, BUT YOU SHOULD BE AWARE THAT IT ALSO LIMITS YOUR RIGHTS TO DISCOVERY AND APPEAL.</blockquote><p>And then follow the opt-out instructions that Equifax provided in an updated terms of service:</p><blockquote>In order to exclude yourself from the arbitration provision, You must notify Equifax in writing within 30 days of the date that You first accept this Agreement on the Site (for Products purchased from Equifax on the Site). … [You] must include Your name, address, and Equifax User ID, as well as a clear statement that You do not wish to resolve disputes with Equifax through arbitration. While this requires that you are proactive, it will help protect yourself from the impact of the arbitration provision in the websites terms of service.</blockquote><p>You should also check your other contracts and service agreements. Arbitration Provisions like those used by Equifax are very common. According to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, a government agency dedicated to protecting consumer rights Arbitration Provision do more harm to consumers than good. In response to the harm consumers suffer as a result of service agreements and contract that include arbitration clauses, the CFPB recently issued a rule that prohibited them from being included in certain banking and payday lending contracts and agreements. The new rule, which takes effect March 19, 2018, is not retroactive, so it does not cover those effected by the Equifax Breach, but it could very well affect you. Unfortunately, the consumer protections offered by the rule may not be here long. As soon as the CFPB announced the rule member of the U.S. House voted to repeal it. A vote from Senate is needed to complete the final repeal. A repeal of the rule would grant personhood to banks and corporation meaning that the rights of an entity have once again trumped the rights of individuals.

Geneva Shade of Arden and Timothy Barwick of Roxboro, along with other of their neighbors, filed a petition to intervene in the rate hike proceeding filed by Duke Energy Progress, LLC. These customers received their electricity directly from Duke Energy, and pay their bills directly to Duke. Also, they live within one-half mile of the Duke coal ash boundaries and have been directly affected by coal ash contamination. In the Duke Energy Progress rate hike request, Duke states that $66 million of the requested $477.5 million rate increase is intended to recover ash basin closure compliance costs incurred since January 1, 2015. In addition, Duke Energy Progress requests to recover $129 million toward ongoing ash basin closure compliance costs, with any difference from the requested amount to be deferred until a future base rate case. The details of Duke Energy Carolina’s request should be filed by August 25th. These rate paying neighbors believe that they have a direct stake in the issues presented by the application as they are currently bearing the burdens of property damages and loss of property value, stigma and the nuisance of not having access to clean tap water, which is now combined with the prospect of an additional burden of increased electricity rates as a result of Duke coal ash costs. Duke is the nation’s largest public utility. Deborah Graham, who lives near Duke’s Buck Plant, echoes the concerns expressed by rate payers who live near the other plants: “After having to live off of bottled water for more than 800 days as a result of Duke’s failure to responsibly manage its coal ash waste, it would add insult to injury to have to pay more every month in my electric bill so that Duke can continue to earn a profit after decades of waste mismanagement.” The families are represented by: • WALLACE & GRAHAM, P.A. -- Mona Lisa Wallace, John Hughes, Marlowe Rary, 525 N.

  blog: '<h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</h4><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\">&nbsp;</h4><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><strong>News Update:&nbsp;</strong><strong>Declaratory Judgment Action Brought against Duke Energy &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong></h4><p>&nbsp; In 2012, Duke Energy became the largest electric utility in the country.[1] With great power comes great responsibility. Duke Energy has a responsibility to deal with the issues that have come to light with coal ash. The 2014 Dan River spill turned a sharp spotlight on those issues. There are hundreds of families who live half a mile or less from Duke’s coal ash plants. They are also Duke Energy customers, or in some cases, customers of smaller utilities who obtain power from Duke. They were promised by Duke that it was a clean, safe, environmentally responsible provider. As it turns out, the power these neighbors paid for also came with dangers from coal ash waste. The Dan River spill and the resulting attention of the regulators and prosecutors exposed the scope of these dangers. Now, Duke is having to remove the coal ash from many of its sites. And at others, a debate is underway over what Duke should do. In the face of all this, the State Legislature passed a bill which requires Duke to provide a permanent replacement water supply to these families. The Coal Ash Management Act, or CAMA for short, reflects a legislative will to err on the side of protecting the families and the safety of their long-term water supply. The families had been using private water wells for their tap water. For years their children drank and bathed in the water. They were told in 2015 that the water was not safe. Then in 2016, they were told it was safe but also learned that some leading scientists and officials disputed that recommendation. And they do not know in the long-term, if the millions of pounds of coal ash still stored at the sites can make their water worse. The coal ash is often stored in wet form, in ponds, which are unlined, meaning they can seep into the ground. The local groundwater serves the private wells. These families are not at any fault for this situation. And they never had to pay a water bill before at these homes, or a hookup cost for a public water line. Many are on a fixed income or of modest means. Duke has agreed to cover some of the costs of public waters service but for other costs, like the cost of future bills, it is asking the families to sign away their right to sue if something should go wrong. The lawsuit filed on August 23, 2017, asks the Court, and asks Duke, to carry through its duty to provide a safe, permanent, replacement water supply, without any strings attached. They ask that Duke abides by the traditional public policy that public utilities should not make consumers sign away their rights when it comes to basic necessities like clean water and clean power.

  blog: '<p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong>PRESS RELEASE</strong> <strong> CLASS ACTION AGAINST DUKE ENERGY</strong> <strong> BROUGHT BY NORTH CAROLINA PLANT NEIGHBORS</strong></p><p><em>August 23, 2017</em> – Amy Brown of Belmont and Deborah Graham of Salisbury, along with representatives of other neighborhoods near Duke power plants, filed a class action lawsuit today in Raleigh. The lawsuit seeks injunctive relief and damages against Duke Energy Carolinas, LLC and Duke Energy Progress, LLC. It asks the court to determine the rights of the local homeowners and of Duke under a financial supplement agreement Duke has offered. Duke is the nation’s largest public utility. The families all live within half a mile of coal ash ponds at Duke’s power plants. Coal ash is the waste generated by coal-fired power plants. When Duke burned coal to generate electricity, it sent the coal ash waste to unlined ponds. The coal ash contains cancer-causing substances and contaminants such as arsenic, lead, manganese, vanadium and heavy metals. Because the ponds were unlined, the contaminants leaked polluting the environment. The families once used private wells and did not have to pay water bills. Then, their water quality was called into question after the Dan River spill. Now, they are in the process of receiving connections to public water supplies. Some of the homes will get water filter systems instead. Under the Coal Ash Management Act passed by the state legislature in 2014 and amended in 2016, Duke must provide connections to public water supplies and filter systems. Duke has also offered $5000 or more to help pay for transition costs and water bills. But for families to get the money, Duke is demanding they must sign a waiver of liability. The families say the waiver is unfair. They question why Duke should be able to make them give up the ability to sue in the future – especially when Duke insists coal ash is not dangerous. Deborah Graham, one of the Plaintiffs, asks: “What if the contaminants were to cause a disease? What if someday, another spill occurs? Why should we give away our right to sue?” Many of these families also pay power bills to Duke. They claim that as a public utility, Duke is not allowed to make them sign a release. The families say they had nothing to do with the coal ash problems that the public utility now faces. Plaintiff Amy Brown states, “My well tested positive for some of the same contaminants that are in the coal ash. I spoke to health officials who told me that my water is not safe for my children to drink. I am not taking any chances when it comes to my children. I have been on bottled water over 800 days.” Deborah Graham adds, “Duke wants us to sign away any claims we might have, present or future, having anything to do with coal ash.

  blog: '<p>If you are around kids, chances are that over the last few months you have seen or heard of Fidget Spinners. These toys began showing up in stores late in 2016 and can be purchased in almost every retail location you can imagine from high-end toy stores to the corner gas station and grocery store checkout lines. These products are marketed to children and are made of plastic and marble sized ball-barons, which allow the toys to be spun, flicked and rolled in a twirling 365 of fluid motion. The fluid rolling motion of the toy and the invent of YouTube, made fidget spinners the hackie-sacs of beaches and playgrounds in 2017, but unlike the schoolyard game of hackie-sac, the fidget spinners are not made to last. There are two major discussions going on about fidget spinners. Parents, educators, and childcare providers have expressed concerns related to both the claims that fidget spinners can be used as a tool to help those with ADHA concentrate or those with anxiety relax and more importantly the safety of the products. First, claims made by retailers that fidget spinners can be used as a tool to help those with ADHA concentrate or those with anxiety relax is a claim that has been around for years. As pointed out in a recent New York Times article, the fidget spinners have been around for years with manufacturers and vendors of the spinners making claims about the products uses as a learning aid for those with attention issues, but according to the Times, those claims have been made without good scientific studies to back them up. Therefore, fidget spinners may or may not help those with concentration or anxiety issues. The second concern voiced by parents, educators, and childcare providers related to fidget spinners is the safety of the products. According to one toy store owner, once she realized she need to start stocking fidget spinners she was able to order the products from online vendors, at whatever volume she needs to stock her shelves- but so were the street vendors and gas stations. The fidget spinners, which are being mass-produced in Chinese’s factories quickly, shipped out to retailer worldwide. As the fidget fade grew, more and more of the toys came to market, it quickly became apparent that some of the cheaply made products would break and fall apart, creating a hazard. The broken fidget spinners soon became a major concern for many caregivers. The United States Consumer Product Safety Commission took notice of those concerns, and in response, on August 10, 2017, the Acting Chairman of the US Consumer Product Safety Commission, Ann Marie Buerkle, issued the following statement to consumers related to the safety of fidget spinners;</p><blockquote><h5 style=\"padding-left: 120px;\"><strong>Statement from Acting Chairman Ann Marie Buerkle Regarding Fidget Spinners &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</strong>August 10, 2017</h5><h5 style=\"padding-left: 120px;\">Fidget spinners have become a phenomenon! They seem to be everywhere.</h5><p style=\"padding-left: 120px;\">As the agency investigates some reported incidents associated with this popular product, fidget spinner users or potential buyers should take some precautions; keep them from small children; the plastic and metal spinners can break and release small pieces that can be a choking hazard; and older children should not put fidget spinners in their mouths.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 120px;\">There have been some reports of fires involving battery-operated fidget spinners. Like any battery-operated product, consumers should be present and pay attention to their devices while charging them. It is important to use the charging cable that either comes with the fidget spinner or one that has the correct connections for the device as charging cables are NOT interchangeable.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 120px;\">Companies should review the CPSC’s guidance on fidget spinners. If a fidget spinner is marketed and is primarily intended for children 12 years of age and younger, companies must certify that their product meets toy safety and other standards, including limits for phthalates, lead content, and lead in paint, if applicable, and the U.S Toy Standard, ASTM F963-16.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 120px;\">I encourage consumers to visit our Fidget Spinner Safety Education Center with additional safety tips and to report safety incidents with fidget spinners to CPSC at www.SaferProducts.gov to help our agency stay on top of this emerging hazard. Fidget spinners can be fun to use but consumers and companies should be aware of some of the safety concerns associated with this product.</p></blockquote><p>The take away for parents and caregivers in regards to the fidget spinner fad – use common sense. Fidget spinners, like most toys, can break, and when they do, the result could be small parts, and those small parts and pieces are a choking hazard.The most important warning parents and caregiver might want to remember is related to battery-operated and chargeable versions of the fidget spinners. The statement mentions that battery-operated fidget spinners could catch fire and that consumers should make sure that they use charging cable compatible with their devices, noting that charging cables are not all interchangeable between different devices. The incompatibility of charges and devices is something we all need to be aware of because it relates to any device we plug into the wall. Overheating and improper device charging of any electronic device is possible, but if a product is made using improper or inadequate materials, or is otherwise cheaply made, cutting safety corners to save in manufacturing cost, it is possible for the product to have defects that make it hazardous. So if your kids or grandkids are begging for a fidget spinner, use common sense. When purchasing a fidget spinner or any children product keeps these tips from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission in mind:</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">• Keep fidget spinners and all toys with small parts away from children under 3 years of age. • The plastic and metal spinners have small pieces (including batteries). Small pieces can be a choking hazard. Choking incidents involving children up to age 14 have &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;been reported. • Warn children of all ages not to put fidget spinners or small pieces in their mouths and not to play with the fidget spinner near their faces. • If a fidget spinner or any toy is broken, it may become hazardous. It should be inspected for hazards like small pieces and sharp corners, and its continued use should &nbsp; &nbsp; be monitored. If a hazard is found the toy should be disposed of.</p><p>Battery-operated products, including fidget spinners.</p><p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\">• Have working smoke alarms in your house to protect you if there is a fire. • Be present when products with batteries are charging. • Never charge a product with batteries overnight while you are sleeping. • Always use the cable that came with the product. • If the product did not come with a cable, make sure to use one with the correct connections for charging. • Electronics and other battery operated devices, like fidget spinners, should be unplugged immediately once they are fully charged.</p><p>For more information from the US Consumer Product Safety Commission related to the safety of the fidget spinners and other products sold in the US, <a href=\"https://www.cpsc.gov/\">visit the US-CPSC website by clicking here</a>. <em>Happy Spinning!</em> <a href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/\"><em>W&G</em></a></p>'

Pleasant, near the scene of an accident involving a tanker truck that rolled over spilling ethanol, were allowed to return home around 8:30 pm last night.</strong></h4><p>The evacuation was lifted after hazardous material crews were able to secure the accident scene and contain the immediate threat posed by the leaking ethanol, which is an extremely combustible fuel. It is not clear as to the amount of ethanol spilled from the tanker, but it took hazardous materials crews several hours to contain and off load the ethanol that did not escape from the tanker, before up righting it and removing it from the scenes. According to local news outlets, the driver of the truck will face charges related to the accident. 2017 Bringle Ferry Tanker Crash and Spill Clean-upPhoto from Salisbury Post The accident in Cabarrus County occurred just as Emergency Management and HAZMAT crews in neighboring Rowan County were cleaning up an ethanol spill that occurred near the Rowan / Davidson County line on Tuesday morning. The accident on Tuesday morning in Rowan county occurred on Bringle Ferry Road and is within a mile of where in 2015 a similar accident occurred, killing the tanker’s driver and spilling thousands of gallons of ethanol. The ethanol from that spill leaked from the truck, on to the roadway and surrounding properties, making its way into the water supply and caused damages to the environment, property, and lives of those living near the site of the accident and spill. The aftermath of the 2015 ethanol spill and subsequent cleanup continues for the property owners that were impacted by that accident. <a title="WBTV Interview" href=\"https://www.wbtv.com/story/36086045/charges-pending-after-truck-hauling-8000-gallons-of-ethanol-overturns" target="_blank\">In an interview with WBTV</a> following the most recent accident on Bringle Ferry Road, two of the residents displaced by the 2015 accident, Shelia Shepard and Jackie Huffman, described the heartache and hardships they have since experienced. They summed up the impact of the damages caused by a substance like ethanol is spilled saying, “Everything in your life changes… in just seconds.” As residents near the site of the ethanol spill in Cabarrus County are a wait to see how this spill will affect the environment, they can look to the property of Shelia Shepard. Today, over two years after the accident, she is still unable to return to the property her family has owned for decades. The property they worked so hard to acquire now sit vacant, scared by deeply dug ditches that were created in an effort to contain the spill, and well-water is contaminated by the ethanol that leeched into the water table supplying her home that she cannot use it. Currently, our law firm is representing Mrs. Shephard and others impacted by that crash. We hope to help them recover some of the losses they have experienced following the ethanol spill and the resulting contamination of the area. In addition, we would also like to ensure that those companies involved in the transportation of ethanol and other hazardous materials are being responsible in the transportation of such materials, and if not they are held accountable for any damages that their negligence has caused.

The evacuation occurred as following a crash that involved a tanker truck that was carrying ethanol. Officials have not said how much ethanol has spilled from the truck, but the tanker has the capacity to hold 8,000 gallons.</p><p>A statement was issued by the Cabarrus County Sheriff&apos;s Office and Cabarrus County Emergency Management notified residents of the spill, and alerting them of the need to the need to evacuate their residence. The statement reads:</p><p><em>“Fire personnel are on the scene of an active fuel spill at the intersection of NC HWY 49 and Lentz Harness Shop Rd. For safety purposes, if you are receiving this call, you are within a half mile of this fuel spill. Fire personnel </em>have<em> asked to evacuate residents within a half mile of the spill.

  blog: '<p>Press Release -- July 31, 2017</p><h3><strong>CLASS ACTION FILED AGAINST MULTINATIONAL CONTRACTOR OVER CATASTROPHIC OUTER BANKS POWER OUTAGE</strong></h3><p>July 31, 2017, Salisbury NC – The Wallace and Graham law firm in Salisbury, NC, working with other attorneys in North and South Carolina, has announced the filing of a lawsuit against PCL Civil Constructors, Inc. regarding the catastrophic power outage which hit part of the North Carolina Outer Banks on July 27th during peak tourist season. The lawsuit was filed in Dare County Superior Court. The power outage was caused when, according to news reports, PCL drove a steel casing through underground transmission cables as part of a project to replace the Bonner Bridge. Thousands of community members in the Hatteras and Ocracoke areas have lost power. Tens of thousands of residents and tourists have had to evacuate. The lawsuit is brought on behalf of affected individuals and businesses. Those suing include Briggs McEwan, whose local pizza and home rental business in Rodanthe claims to have lost thousands of dollars already. Another Plaintiff, Tami Lynette Gray of Frisco, claims that her charter boating business has suffered significant losses, as well. “For people in the Hatteras and Ocracoke areas, this outage is causing significant harm. We have moved quickly to seek to make our clients’ voices heard in this ongoing crisis and obtain judicial relief,” states Mona Lisa Wallace of Wallace and Graham, P.A. PCL Civil Constructors lists a principal office in Raleigh on its website. In addition, the lawsuit names two other PCL affiliates. According to the lawsuit, PCL markets itself as having special expertise on bridge replacement projects. The work is being performed under a contract with the North Carolina Department of Transportation. The goal is to replace the Herbert C. Bonner Bridge across Oregon Inlet from Bodie Island to Hatteras Island. The estimated cost of the project is $250 million or more. The bridge spans nearly three miles. The complaint alleges that in order to win the contract, PCL claimed it could save $60 million or more by working under an accelerated schedule. The lawsuit claims that in the process of trying to proceed with the work, the power lines were cut. The affected power transmission cables go near and under the south side of the Bonner Bridge. The underground lines carry electricity to the island coastal communities from mainland Dare County. Dennis Rose and Peebles Harrison of the law firm of Rose Harrison & Gilreath, and Cheryl Perkins and Jim Gilreath of law firms in South Carolina, are also assisting with the matter. Mr. Rose comments that “as a firm representing clients in the Outer Banks area, we can tell you that this power outage could not have happened at a worse time. We are getting calls from local residents and business owners who have been damaged in a variety of ways.” To Contact Wallace & Graham, P.A. call us directly at 1-800-849-5291 &nbsp; For more information contact: Dennis C.

  blog: '<p>According to a report from the <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2C6GiPE" target="_blank\">Winston-Salem Journal</a>, a three-judge panel of the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in New York has denied a second appeal from cigarette maker R.J. Reynolds, upholding a ruling from the lower court that awards a $28 million dollar judgment to a Connecticut smoker that developed cancer. At 36 years old, Norwich, Connecticut resident Barbara Izzarelli had her larynx, commonly called the Voicebox, removed. She had smoked R.J. Reynold’s brand of Salem Kings cigarettes for 25 years. In 1999, after surviving laryngeal cancer, Izzarelli sued the Winston-Salem, North Carolina-based R.J. Reynold and the court awarded her a $28 million dollar judgment. In the initial lawsuit, filed under the Connecticut products Liability Act, lawyers for Izzarelli alleged the cigarette was designed to include deadly ingredients, which R.J. Reynolds had knowingly manipulated leading to the nicotine in Salem Kings to get nonsmokers addicted and smokers to smoke more -- claims that R.J. Reynolds continues to deny. The case ended with Izzarelli being awarded a $28 million judgment against R.J. Reynolds Tobacco. The company quickly appealed the judgment. The appeal sent the case back to court, through the lengthy appeals process. That process included a March 2011 stop in trial court to make a determination about the breakdown of the original judgement, where it was determined the initial decision include $15.8 million in judgement interest. That was followed by another hearing where a jury determined that Izzarelli had some accountability for her illness, placing her 42% at fault or responsible for her illness, and determining R.J. Reynold’s be 58% to blame. Following this decision R.J. Reynold has continued to deny any responsibility for Izzarelli’s cancer, prolonging the appeals process as the case worked through the courts. In May of this year, as part of the appeals process, lawyers for both parties met for a briefing with the court regarding the facts of the case. According to reports, the most recent decisions handed down in the case resulted from that meeting. The rulings announced by the court on July 7, upheld the $28 million dollar judgment awarded to Izzarelli by the lower court. In addition to upholding the judgment against cigarette maker, the three-judge panel made a ruling that will send the case back to the trial court to see if the company must pay additional punitive damages. The panel of judges also made an additional, possibly more significant ruling related to the case. In their decision, the judges also determined that there was sufficient evidence to support Izzarelli’s claims that the design of the cigarette played a role in her cancer, with the panel of judges finding that “the particular blend of ingredients in Salem Kings caused” her laryngeal cancer. After the panel&apos;s ruling was announced, attorneys for R. J. Reynolds requested a new trial, citing claims of erroneous evidentiary rulings. The panel denied their request, bring the case one-step closer to complete for Barbara Izzarelli who is now 51 years old and living as a cancer survivor in Florida.

According to the CBS report, the class of drugs known as proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) are used to reduce stomach acid and are available over-the-counter and by prescription. The study, conducted by Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis, reviewed data collected by the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs. It looked at 275,933 people who had been prescribed a PPI and 73,355 who had been prescribed an H2 blocker (another type of drug used to reduce stomach acid) between October 2006 and September 2008. They then followed the data about both groups for five years to determine how many from the study had died. The results of the study found a 25 percent increased risk of death in the patients who took the PPI compared to those who took H2 blockers – about one extra death for every 500 people taking a PPI each year.

  blog: '<p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><em><strong>According to an investigation conducted by NPR, cases of Black Lung disease are still occurring in numbers much higher than previously reported.</strong></em></span> Black Lung is the name most commonly used when discussing progressive massive fibrosis, a disease most common to coal miners. The disease is a type of pneumoconiosis a disease of the lungs, and it caused by to inhalation of dust, characterized by inflammation, coughing, and fibrosis. The occupations that are related to the coal industry have been pinpointed for years as occupations where workers have been most often exposed to coal dust and silica particles leading to the classification of Coal worker’s pneumoconiosis&nbsp;a progressive disease that causes Black Lung. In recent months, the Coal Industry has made headlines. The Trump Administration has vowed to lift the restrictions on “Clean Coal,” and to bring mining jobs back to the coal workers of the Appalachian region. Comedian John Oliver took on the Coal Industry in his HBO show <em><a href=\"https://youtu.be/aw6RsUhw1Q8\">Last Week Tonight</a>,</em> and the National Geographic&nbsp;Channel just aired a documentary <a href=\"https://www.fromtheashes.com\">“From the Ashes”</a> that looked at the totality of the industries impact from the extraction of coal to the after affects the use of coal has had on both people and the environment. The recent discussions related to the coal industry have been numerous, but they have only scratched the surface of the real impact the coal industry has on the workers. One news organization has been following the health of coal industry employees, and their investigation has shown that Black Lung disease is still a major health hazard for coal workers. For the last several years, investigative reporters from National Public Radio (NPR) have been involved in researching Black Lung disease. The data they have collected is alarming, with their research finding the number of miners afflicted by the disease to be much, much higher than the numbers that have been reported by government agencies. The most recent report filed by NPR investigative reporters was discussed on a June 30,, 2017 edition of the NPR show<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/2017/06/30/534978067\"> All Things Considered</a>. The show titled, “Government Researchers Plan Response to Rising Rates of Black Lung Disease,” covered a meeting of government that occurred in late June, as a response to the data collected and reported by NPR investigators, and a federal study, both of which showed much higher rates of Black Lung disease than previously reported. In that report, NPR investigators uncovered 2,000 cases of black lung disease compared to the 99 case of the disease reported by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH), the government agency responsible for the collection and reporting of occupational diseases and illness. The meeting covered by NPR reporter Howard Berkes, was the government’s response to those findings. At that meeting, Epidemiologist Scott Laney and a team of agents from the NIOSH hoped to set the groundwork for a plan to combat the growing number of Black Lung case found in the central Appalachian region. During a presentation to a National Academy of Science committee investigating efforts to control the coal mine dust that causes the disease, Laney told attendees gathered at the conference that, “there’s a great deal of evidence … that demonstrates that we are in the midst of an epidemic of black lung disease in central Appalachia." This statement echoed one he had made in front of coal miners, medical students, physicians, and attorneys meeting in Pikesville, Kentucky in April of this year. During that presentation, Laney told attendees that they were at the epicenter of one of the largest industrial medicine disasters that the United States has ever seen." The recent meetings will not provide an immediate solution to those already impacted by the devastating effects of Coal worker’s pneumoconiosis or those who have advanced into the later stages of Black Lung disease. The meetings do not mean that coal miners will be protected from inhaling the coal dust and silica that floats freely in their workspace. It does, however, show that someone somewhere is watching those responsible for watching the industry, and that scientist and researchers, corporations and government agencies are all aware of the negative health effects coal industry workers face. &nbsp; <strong>For more information about Black Lung disease and the coal industry visit these links:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.lung.org/lung-health-and-diseases/lung-disease-lookup/pneumoconiosis/\">The American Lung Association – Pneumoconiosis Information</a> <strong>To review the Reports from NPR (National Public Radio) related to Black Lung visit the links below:</strong> • <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/2017/06/30/534978067\">All Things Considered, June 30, 2017</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/programs/all-things-considered/2017/06/30/534978067\">Government Researchers Plan Response to Rising Rates Of Black Lung Disease</a> <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2012/07/05/156302772/what-is-black-lung\">• What Is Black Lung?

  blog: '<p>Department of Labor: OSHA FINDS MACHINE SAFETY HAZARDS, SILICA OVEREXPOSURE AT OHIO STEEL PLANT GROVEPORT, Ohio – Amsted Rail Company Inc., a manufacturer of cast steel freight components, faces $610,034 in proposed penalties from the U.S. Department of Labor’s Occupational Safety and Health Administration after agency investigators found workers at its Groveport plant exposed to machine hazards and silica. OSHA found one worker was hospitalized after suffering severe injuries when he was caught in a machine, and at least four workers were exposed to excessive levels of silica, which can cause serious health issues. “Companies must ensure their workers are trained in proper machine safety procedures and provided the necessary personal protective equipment to prevent injuries and illness on the job,” said Dorothy Dougherty, deputy assistant secretary of labor for Occupational Safety and Health. “Continuous monitoring of facilities and procedures are important components of an effective safety and health program.” On Jan. 3, 2017, a 60-year-old maintenance worker’s leg was crushed after he was caught in a core baker machine while conducting maintenance. OSHA’s investigation found multiple instances of machine safety violations including failing to lock out machinery to prevent movement during servicing. A second inspection was opened on Feb. 22, 2017, after OSHA inspectors found workers exposed to silica at amounts over the permissible exposure limit. Investigators documented four incidents of silica overexposure in the facility. In total, the agency found six repeat, 19 serious and five other-than-serious safety and health violations during the two inspections. OSHA found Amsted Rail failed to implement engineering controls to lower exposure to silica, affix locking devices to machine operating parts during maintenance, adequately guard machinery, implement a respiratory protection program, evaluate permit-required confined spaces, guard floor openings and shafts to prevent falls and provide adequate personal protective equipment. Amsted Rail has been placed in OSHA’s Severe Violator Enforcement Program. The company has 15 business days from receipt of its safety and health citations and penalties to comply, request an informal conference with OSHA’s area director, or contest the findings before the independent Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission. To ask questions, obtain compliance assistance, file a complaint, or report amputations, eye loss, workplace hospitalizations, fatalities or situations posing imminent danger to workers, the public should call OSHA’s toll-free hotline at 800-321-OSHA (6742) or the agency’s Columbus Area Office at 614-469-5582. Under the Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970, employers are responsible for providing safe and healthful workplaces for their employees. OSHA’s role is to ensure these conditions for America’s working men and women by setting and enforcing standards and providing training, education and assistance.

Specifically, the studies showed that leg and foot amputations occurred about twice as often in patients treated with <strong><em>CANAGLIFLOZIN</em></strong> compared to patients treated with placebo, which is an inactive treatment.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn1" name="_ednref1\">[i]</a> &nbsp; In the study, the most common amputation was the toe and middle of the foot, although some patients required amputations further up their leg, both above and below the knee. There was also patients that required multiple amputations, and others that required some level of amputation on both legs.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn2" name="_ednref2\">[ii]</a> &nbsp; The FDA advises patients that are <strong><em>currently taking CANAGLIFLOZIN</em></strong> to speak with their healthcare provider about any concerns or before they stop taking <strong><em>CANAGLIFLOZIN. If you have diabetes and are currently prescribed CANAGLIFLOZIN, you should</em></strong> speak with your healthcare provider before you stop taking <strong><em>CANAGLIFLOZIN.</em></strong><strong><em> Most importantly, if you are taking CANAGLIFLOZIN and develop new pain or tenderness</em></strong> sores or ulcers, or infections in your legs or feet you should immediately notify the physician to discuss the possible risk. &nbsp; If you are a physician that prescribes <strong><em>CANAGLIFLOZIN to patients</em></strong> for the treatment of individuals with type 2 diabetes the FDA recommends that you review your prescribing practices. Before giving the drug to patients, it is important to be informed of your patient&apos;s medical history. The FDA warns the increased risk of amputation related to CANAGLIFLOZIN is more common in patients with a medical history that includes&nbsp;prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, and diabetic foot ulcers. If you have considered and discussed the risk with your patient and decided to prescribe <strong><em>CANAGLIFLOZIN, patients should be closely monitored for potential complications.</em></strong></p><p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>The FDA ask that patients and healthcare providers report any issues related to CANAGLIFLOZIN.</em></strong></p><p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong><strong><em>To read the CANAGLIFLOZIN (Invokana, Invokamet, Invokamet XR) -- FDA Safety Announcement or Report an issue follow the link below:&nbsp;</em></strong></p><p style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm557507.htm?source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery%20%20" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\"><strong><em>CANAGLIFLOZIN (Invokana, Invokamet, Invokamet XR)&nbsp;FDA INFORMATION</em></strong></a></p><p>&nbsp; <a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_ednref1" name="_edn1\">[i]</a><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm557507.htm?source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery\">https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm557507.htm?source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery</a> <a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_ednref2" name="_edn2\">[ii]</a><a href=\"https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm557507.htm?source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery\">https://www.fda.gov/Drugs/DrugSafety/ucm557507.htm?source=govdelivery&utm_medium=email&utm_source=govdelivery</a> &nbsp;</p>'

The film, </em>produced by Michael Bonfiglio of RadicalMedia in partnership with Bloomberg Philanthropies, seeks to provide a realistic, unbiased, clear-eyed examination of the impact of the coal industry, and who, what and how’s of the industry’s impact. The film discusses issues ranging from the economy and the environment to the health and safety of communities and individuals working and living near coal mining and coal-fueled energy production facilities. &nbsp; <em>A </em><em>New York Times</em><em> review of the film finds it provides “a concise overview of the issues,” without placing blame on business executives or politicians, instead, letting those most impacted tell their own stories of how their land, air, water, and lives have been affected by the coal industry. Going on the say that ‘From the Ashes,’ does not need much commentary from corporate or political spokespeople, because the dismay and sorrow of those most impacted speaks for itself through the stories told in the film. </em> &nbsp; Some of the stories included in the film are those of local residences in Dukeville, North Carolina. The small community of Dukeville, which is not far from the Buck Steam Station, is featured because of the effects of pollutions from the operation of the power station, which led to the state of North Carolina noting residence in April 2015 that the community’s water was not safe to drink. Following the state&apos;s warning, the community worked to hold Duke Energy, the operator of the Buck Steam Station, accountable for the toxic impact of their actions. According to Will Scott, Yadkin Riverkeeper, “Duke has to clean up,” this will include cleaning up coal ash and running a water line to the community to provide them with clean water. Scott called the community’s efforts a “testament to what a small community can do, even against the country’s largest utility, to defend their right to clean water.” &nbsp; See below for a listing of Free Community Screenings of “From the Ashes.” &nbsp; Form more information about the documentary, “From the Ashes” visit the film’s website at <a href=\"https://www.fromtheashesfilm.com\">www.fromtheashesfilm.com</a> &nbsp; Tune into the National Geographic Channel premiere of “From the Ashes” on June 25<sup>th</sup> at 9 p.m. &nbsp; &nbsp; <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">&nbsp;</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">FREE COMMUNITY SCREENING OF “FROM THE ASHES”</span> &nbsp; SALISBURY&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thursday, June 15, at 6:30 PM Location: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Norvell Theatre, 135 E.

The May 31, 2017, announcement was made that Cirina will become a subsidiary of Grail. This news means that the two relatively new cancer research organizations can consolidate their resources and focus into a joint research effort that may pave the way for huge advancements in the early detection of cancer. &nbsp; Both Grail and Cirina have only been in operation for less than 5 years, and both companies are new teams in the cancer diagnostic research and development industry. While the teams may be new to the league, both companies are comprised of team members that have playing in the major leagues of genomics research before. These players bring with the dedication that has provides both companies with stability and creditability, that has secured funding sources, in turn allowing this merger effort to go forward. &nbsp; <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">GRAIL</span></em></strong> Grail, based in California, is a life sciences company that focuses on the development and validation of cancer-detecting blood tests that allow for the early detection of cancer. The CEO of Grail, Jeff Huber, is a former GoogleX executive and leader in the field of Big Data and its relationship to science and technology took leadership of the company at its on-set in 2016, shortly after his wife died from cancer. &nbsp; The birth of Grail occurred in mid-2016, as a spin off from Illumina, a leading genomics research DNA sequencing firm. The spin-off of the company was made possible following a start-up investment of more than $100 million from Bill Gates, Jeff Bezos, Google, and others.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn1" name="_ednref1\">[i]</a> &nbsp; Grail has had a successful first year. In March 2017, the company announced that it had raised an additional $900 million from a second round of investors. With major funding led by ARCH Venture Partners and includes Amazon, Bezos Expeditions, Bill Gates, Bristol-Myers Squibb, Celgene, GV, Illumina, Johnson & Johnson Innovation, Merck, McKesson Ventures, Sutter Hill Ventures, Tencent, Varian Medical Systems, and other financial partners.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn2" name="_ednref2\">[ii]</a> &nbsp; US-based Grail has been infused with a $900 million dollar shot of investment funds at its disposal, the partnership with Hong Kong-based <strong><em>Cirina</em></strong> will further expand both facilities research and development abilities, as well as expand the depth of both companies knowledge, with the ultimate goal of making significate advancements in the early detection of cancer through blood testing. &nbsp; <strong><em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Cirina</span></em></strong> An industry leader also heads Cirina, and much like Grail, is composed of a well-rounded group of researchers. Cirina founded in 2014 at the Chinese University of Hong Kong. The company’s co-founder, Dennis Lo, is a trailblazer in the study of plasma nucleic acid, which is the information, or identifying markers found in DNA. DNA is the genetic code that is uniquely specific to each individual, and is considered the blueprint to all of the things that makes us, us. &nbsp; As a researcher Lo was the first person to discover the presence of fetal DNA in a pregnant mother’s blood-plasma, a discovery that showed the cells of a developing fetus cross the placental and blood-brain barriers and transfer from the child to the&nbsp; during pregnancy.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn3" name="_ednref3\">[iii]</a> In the years following his discovery, the field of genomics and DNA sequencing has continued to grow. Many new discoveries related to DNA and human genetics have followed Lo’s findings, including promising research related to how to detect the presences of cancer markers in the human body by utilizing blood-plasma testing, a process that has been successful in the identification of diseases, and various types of cancer, including lung, colon, and breast.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn4" name="_ednref4\">[iv]</a> &nbsp; <a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_ednref1" name="_edn1\">[i]</a> From &lt;<a href=\"https://shift.newco.co/chasing-the-grail-bill-gates-jeff-bezos-illumina-and-google-ventures-are-betting-this-company-6211cf2e086e\">https://shift.newco.co/chasing-the-grail-bill-gates-jeff-bezos-illumina-and-google-ventures-are-betting-this-company-6211cf2e086e</a>&gt; <a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_ednref2" name="_edn2\">[ii]</a> <a href=\"https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/05/31/1003871/0/en/GRAIL-and-Cirina-Combine-to-Create-Global-Company-Focused-on-Early-Detection-of-Cancer.html\">https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2017/05/31/1003871/0/en/GRAIL-and-Cirina-Combine-to-Create-Global-Company-Focused-on-Early-Detection-of-Cancer.html</a> <a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_ednref3" name="_edn3\">[iii]</a> From <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633676/\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2633676/</a>&gt; . <a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_ednref4" name="_edn4\">[iv]</a> From &lt;<a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12142371\">https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12142371</a>&gt;</p>'

  blog: '<p>In the News: INACCURATE LEAD TESTING KITS May 18, 2017 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) are warning Americans that some Lead testing systems may provide inaccurate results. The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warning that all four of Magellan Diagnostics’ lead testing systems: LeadCare; LeadCare II; LeadCare Plus; and LeadCare Ultra may provide inaccurate results. According to a Saftey Warning issued by both agencies, the Magellan Diagnostics’ lead testing systems have been producing a test with falsely low results when blood drawn from a vein is used for testing. Lead exposure and poisoning can be harmful especially to children six years and younger, pregnant women and nursing mothers. Lead is naturally occurring substance, but it can have toxic effects on humans and animals, and most human exposure to lead comes from human activity. Lead and lead dust can be found in the air we breathe and the water we drink. Through the years, lead has been used in a variety of products, and it has been released into our atmosphere as a result of burning fossil fuels and as it is used in industrial manufacturing process. Lead can affect almost every organ in the body, and the side effects of exposure can vary. Children are the most susceptible to the effects of lead. While all adults should avoid lead exposure, it is even more paramount for pregnant women and nursing mothers, because lead present in the bloodstream can be passed along to a developing fetus or to a nursing child. Experts warn that children exposed to lead, even low levels can be affected. Some possible results of lead exposure are: • Behavior and learning problems • Lower IQ and Hyperactivity • Slowed growth • Hearing Problems • Anemia Lead exposure can have lasting impacts, and therefore it is important for healthcare providers to monitor lead exposure, especially in high-risk populations. Due to the concerns related to lead exposure patients and physicians need to be able to depend on the accuracy of the medical test that checks the levels of lead in the bloodstream. This FDA and CDC’s response to the inaccuracy of the Magellan Diagnostics’ lead testing kits is a testament to the importance of monitoring at-risk populations for lead exposure. Representatives from both the FDA and CDC have voiced their concerns about the issues. In a statement Jeffrey Shuren, M.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health stated that “The FDA is deeply concerned by this situation and is warning laboratories and health care professionals that they should not use any Magellan Diagnostics’ lead tests with blood drawn from a vein.” He went on to say that the “agency is aggressively investigating this complicated issue to determine the cause of the inaccurate results and working with the CDC and other public health partners to address the problem as quickly as possible.” The CDC is recommending that children younger than six years (72 months) of age, women who are currently pregnant or nursing, at the time of this alert (May 17, 2017) be retested if their test was conducted using blood drawn from a vein using any Magellan Diagnostics’ LeadCare System tests. Any other children and adults that have been tested for lead exposure and are concerned about the accuracy of their results should contact their healthcare provider’s to discuss the potential need for retesting.

  blog: '<p>In the News: Drug Safety May 18, 2017 FDA issues a safety warning related to diabetes medicine CANAGLIFLOZIN (Invokana, Invokamet, Invokamet XR) On March 16, 2017, the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) issued a Drug Safety Announcement related to the diabetes medicine CANAGLIFLOZIN based on data from two large clinical trials. CANAGLIFLOZIN is used to treat individuals with type 2 diabetes and is sold under the brand names Invokana, Invokamet, and Invokamet XR. According to the FDA announcement, the new clinical trial data shows that patients taking the drug CANAGLIFLOZIN were at an increased risk of leg and foot amputations. Specifically, the studies showed that leg and foot amputations occurred about twice as often in patients treated with CANAGLIFLOZIN compared to patients treated with placebo, which is an inactive treatment. In the study, the most common amputation was the toe and middle of the foot, although some patients required amputations further up their leg, both above and below the knee. There was also patients that required multiple amputations, and others that required some level of amputation on both legs. The FDA advises patients that are currently taking CANAGLIFLOZIN to speak with their healthcare provider about any concerns or before they stop taking CANAGLIFLOZIN. If you have diabetes and are currently prescribed CANAGLIFLOZIN, you should speak with your healthcare provider before you stop taking CANAGLIFLOZIN. Most importantly, if you are taking CANAGLIFLOZIN and develop new pain or tenderness sores or ulcers, or infections in your legs or feet you should immediately notify the physician to discuss the possible risk. If you are a physician that prescribes CANAGLIFLOZIN to patients for the treatment of individuals with type 2 diabetes the FDA recommends that you review your prescribing practices. Before giving the drug to patients, it is important to be informed of your patient&apos;s medical history. The FDA warns the increased risk of amputation related to CANAGLIFLOZIN is more common in patients with a medical history that includes prior amputation, peripheral vascular disease, neuropathy, and diabetic foot ulcers. If you have considered and discussed the risk with your patient and decided to prescribe CANAGLIFLOZIN, patients should be closely monitored for potential complications. The FDA ask that patients and healthcare providers report any issues related to CANAGLIFLOZIN.

Those programs include various food, farm and forestry programs, which deal with a variety of related issues, ranging from agricultural subsidies to conservation and rural development, and even reaching into food and nutrition programs, such as food stamps and federal subsidized school meals. As Perdue takes his position at the lead of the USDA, he faces several challenges including falling farm prices, request for additional agricultural subsidies, a dispute with Canada’s dairy industry and a president that has proposed a 21% cut the USDA. All of this comes as the countdown to the 2018 expiration of the current farm bill looms close.

  blog: '<h3>CRISPR one of the newest discoveries in the word of human genomics, is arming T-Cells to fight cancer</h3><p>New advances in sequences and editing DNA are common occurrences in the field of genomics. Scientist are regularly seeking new ways to harness the power of the human genome to prevent, protect and cure the human body. The newest of those findings related to mapping the human genome is known as CRISPR (pronounced&nbsp;<em>crisper)</em> Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR<em>) </em>is one of the newest discoveries in the word of human genomics, and could hold the key to understand and preventing diseases. While mapping the human genome, scientist discovered CRISPRs, which are segments of prokaryotic DNA, and work as a key to unlock each segment in the overall sequence. CRISPR is quickly gaining ground in the field of genomics, its uses and potential for how it can be harness are exponential. One area where the CRISPR technology has shown the greatest potential is in the fight against cancer. From this discovery they have created tools that allow them to further unlock the human genome, one of these tools, CRISPR-Cas9. According to the National Human Genome Research Institute,&nbsp;CRISPR-Cas9 is a customizable tool that lets scientists cut and insert small pieces of DNA at precise areas along a DNA strand. This allows for scientist to control a particular trait in DNA. The CRISPR technology allows them to guide a Cas9 protein the desired gene, or segment of DNA, in a way that is specific, targeted and in real-time. Thus allowing for more precise study of the impact of changes or mutations in the genes or segments of the DNA sequences, and the overall impact of those changes on the cells and the organism. (<a href=\"https://bit.ly/2OwU2cC\">https://bit.ly/2OwU2cC</a>) A recent paper by Michel Sadelain, M.D., Ph.D., of Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, and his colleagues found CRISPR also has tremendous potential in cancer treatments as well. The team reported that in recent studies they had edited the T-cells to recognize and attack cancer cells that expressed certain a type of protein marker or antigen, in a way reprogramming the T-cells, the protectors cells in the blood system, to kill off any potentially harmful invading cells that carry the targeted antigen by producing a chimeric antigen receptor proteins (CARs). <a href=\"https://www.mskcc.org/press-releases/car-cells-more-powerful-when-built-crispr-msk-researchers-find\">https://www.mskcc.org/press-releases/car-cells-more-powerful-when-built-crispr-msk-researchers-find</a> The new discovery could provide doctors with a new, directed method of immunotherapy for the treatment of cancer. Dr. Sadelain, Director of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mskcc.org/research-areas/labs/michel-sadelain/overview\">Center for Cell Engineering and the Gene Transfer and Gene Expression Laboratory at </a>Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center explained the importance of this type of cancer treatment.

  blog: '<p>Faulty guardrails are back in the news after the father of teen killed in a Tennessee crash receives a bill for $2,970 to replace the guardrail that killed his daughter. In the early morning hours of November 1, 2016 Steven Eimers’ 17-year-old daughter Hannah Eimers was driving a 2000 Volvo S80 northbound on Interstate 75 near Niota, Tennessee when her car left the road, traveling into the median, and sending the car into the end of a guardrail with the impact occurring in the area of the driver-side door. According to the Tennessee Highway Patrol accident report, instead of acting as safety mechanism, and defecting or absorbing the impact, the guardrail instead impaled the vehicle, striking the teen in the head and chest, pushing&nbsp;her into the back seat, and killing her on impact. According to several news agencies, Steven Eimers claims that four months after his daughters death, the Tennessee Department of Transportation, sent her a bill for the cost of labor and materials to install 25 feet of guardrail at the scene of the crash. The guardrail, the deceased teen had been billed to replace was a known safety hazard. According to transportation officials, the x-Lite guardrail end, which is supposed to collapse like a telescope when hit on the end,&nbsp;didn&apos;t always work as expected at speeds higher than about 60 mph, along the section of I-75 where Hannah Eimers crash occurred the posted speed limit is 70-mph. While Steven Eimers was upset at receiving the bill he was even more upset that the state of Tennessee was using the X-LITE guardrail end, a model that the state transportation department had removed from its approved products list just one week earlier. The removal of the guardrails X-LITE guardrail ends from roadways in Tennessee and states across the country came after the safety of the products were called into question in a whistleblower lawsuit. The suit, filed by whistleblower Joshua Harman claimed that the maker of the guardrails, Trinity Industries, had altered its ET-Plus model terminal without getting approval from the Federal Highway Administration. Speaking to the unapproved design changes, Harman stated that the approved design had “worked perfectly&nbsp;and they changed it for monetary reasons and now it&apos;s killing people.” Harman won his suit and the federal government reached a $633 million settlement against Trinity Industries. As a result, numerous lawsuits have been filed nationwide in which crash victims alleged the unauthorized changes caused the guardrails to spear vehicles, resulting in&nbsp;injuries and deaths. In addition to the X-Lite guardrail system another commonly used guardrail system, the ET Plus system. The ET Plus system was removed from the approved list by the Tennessee Department of Transportation, as well as numerous other states transportation agencies in 2014 after the Federal Government raised questions about the safety of the terminal.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1\">[1]</a> This past week the Tennessee Dept. of transportation announced, that based on fall an analysis of the X-Lite System, that included crash data and included the number of fatalities, the department had decided to remove all X-Lite guardrails in areas of higher speeds, more than 45 miles per hour. Totaling about 1,000 systems that will require replacement. Not all states have taken the same stance as Tennessee. For example North Carolina is still using the questionable guardrail systems. A 2015 report by new station WRAL in Raleigh states that NC is one of the only states that have not banned the guard Mr. Eimers plans to work to make the roads we all use safer to travel. He stated, "What bothers me is that they’re playing Russian roulette with people&apos;s lives. They know these devices do not perform at high speeds and in situations like my daughter’s accident, but they leave them in place." He went on to conclude that he wanted to be able to look at other parents whose lives may be impacted by such a tragedy and say, &apos;I tried to make some changes in the culture of TDOT.&nbsp;I tried to get some dangerous devices off the road.’ State transportation department spokesman Mark Nagi apologized to the family of Hannah Eimers, calling the bill a result of "a mistake somewhere in processing.” Nagi went on to explain that the State is planning to take action. He said that the transportation department&apos;s removal of the model from its product list means the agency will not use it&nbsp;in new installations, but roughly 1,000 guardrail ends will remain on Tennessee roads. He also explained that as of March 31<sup>st</sup>, the transportation department will begin accepting bids for a contract to remove most of them in places where the speed limit exceeds 45 mph.” OTHER <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">CASES</span> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">January 26, 2014:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hillsborough NC</span> Jay Traylor’s SUV&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.wral.com/graham-man-saves-his-own-life-after-leg-severed-in-crash/13374897/\">veered off Interstate 40 in Hillsborough</a>&nbsp;on Jan. 26, 2014, and into an ET Plus guardrail.

  blog: '<p>The new class of pharmaceuticals are showing promise in the treatment of some forms of cancer. The new class of drugs known as immunotherapies work by empowering the body’s immune system to fight against the tumor cells, slowing the effects and extending the lives of some cancer patients. According to the American Cancer Society immunotherapy, sometimes called <em>biologic</em><em> therapy</em>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<em>biotherapy</em>, can be done in a couple of ways:</p><ul class="list"><li>Stimulating your own immune system to work harder or smarter to attack cancer cells</li><li>Giving you immune system components, such as man-made immune system proteins.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn1" name="_ednref1\">[i]</a></li></ul><p>Immunotherapy has been found to be an effective treatment for many types of cancer, and research is currently being conducted to further study the potential of these types of treatments. At present, there are 4 main ways that immunotherapy can be used to treat cancer, each working in a slightly different way to utilize the pre-existing protections offered by the immune system. The uses of immunotherapy treatments include:</p><ul class="list"><li><a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/immunotherapy/monoclonal-antibodies.html\"><strong>Monoclonal antibodies</strong></a><strong>:</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong>These are man-made versions of immune system proteins. Antibodies can be very useful in treating cancer because they can be designed to attack a very specific part of a cancer cell.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/immunotherapy/immune-checkpoint-inhibitors.html\"><strong>Immune checkpoint inhibitors</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;These drugs basically take the ‘brakes’ off the immune system, which helps it recognize and attack cancer cells.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/immunotherapy/cancer-vaccines.html\"><strong>Cancer vaccines</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;Vaccines are substances put into the body to start an immune response against certain diseases. We usually think of them as being given to healthy people to help prevent infections. But some vaccines can help prevent or treat cancer.</li><li><a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatments-and-side-effects/treatment-types/immunotherapy/nonspecific-immunotherapies.html\"><strong>Other, non-specific immunotherapies</strong></a><strong>:</strong>&nbsp;These treatments boost the immune system in a general way, but this can still help the immune system attack cancer cells.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn2" name="_ednref2\">[ii]</a></li></ul><p>As patients and doctors seek treatment options to combat cancer diagnosis, they are now seeking out the option of immunotherapy. Currently, there are treatments being tested and developed by major pharmaceutical companies, with each bring their own formula to the marketplace. Two of the major pharmaceutical companies, Merck & Co. and Bristol-Myers Squibb, have been working to produce their own immunotherapeutic compound, and are completing various clinical trials to determine the effectiveness of their formulations.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn3" name="_ednref3\">[iii]</a> Merck is expecting the FDA to review its application to combine its immune system-boosting drug Keytruda with chemotherapy as an initial therapy for advanced lung cancer, a decision that is expected on May 10<sup>th</sup> 2017.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn4" name="_ednref4\">[iv]</a> The emerging leader in cancer immunotherapy is Keytruda. Keytruda, manufactured by Merck has shown promising signs as a treatment for patients with mesothelioma cancer. The antibody drug has been used to treat melanoma, non-small cell lung cancer, head and neck cancers, and now mesothelioma.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn5" name="_ednref5\">[v]</a> Merck&apos;s Keytruda alone is already approved as an initial, or first-line, treatment for advanced lung cancer in patients whose tumors have a high level of PD-L1 expression, the protein that the drug targets to help the immune system fight cancer.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn6" name="_ednref6\">[vi]</a><a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_ftn1" name="_ftnref1\">[1]</a> A recent report by Fox Business, according to the QuintilesIMS Institute, between 2005 and 2015 the pharmaceutical industry expanded research and development, opening up the pipeline of available cancer drug treatment by 63%, with numerous drug actually becoming available to those needing treatment options.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn7" name="_ednref7\">[vii]</a> See the chart below for information on the currently approved Cancer immunotherapy options and the cancers they target.<strong><em>&nbsp;</em></strong> <strong><em>REMEMBER:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </em></strong> The available treatments are constantly changing.

  blog: '<p>Roundup® is the brand name for glyphosate, a chemical herbicide used to control the growth of weeds has recently been linked to cases of cancer, specifically non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Recent scientific studies have called into question the safety of the weed killing chemical Round-up and other glyphosate based products.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn1" name="_ednref1\">[i]</a> <a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn2" name="_ednref2\">[ii]</a>The new concerns regarding the safety of these products has the potential to impact health globally. First introduced in 1974, Roundup® is currently one of the most widely used weed control products in the world. According to Monsanto, the makers of Roundup, the product is used worldwide in over 130 countries and is approved for weed control on more than 100 varieties of crops.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn3" name="_ednref3\">[iii]</a> Roundup® and other products with glyphosate as the main active ingredients work by disrupting the production of enzymes involved in the production of amino acids. The amino acids are critical in the life cycle of plants, and by blocking the production of the enzyme, the plant or weed loses its viability, slowly wilting away the weeds until they turn brown and die.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn4" name="_ednref4\">[iv]</a> According to the National Pesticide Information Center, in addition to Roundup® there are over 750 products that contain glyphosate. These products can come in several forms and can be found in a solid salt-like material or an amber-colored liquid formula and is generally applied in a spray or mist form to the leaves of weeds or other invasive plants.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn5" name="_ednref5\">[v]</a> Exposure to glyphosate in humans can occur both during and after the application of the product. Exposure can occur in various ways. It can get into your eyes, it can be inhaled, digested and it can also be absorbed through the skin. Once applied the chemical does not tend to vaporize, thus leaving the possibility for unintended exposure to occur. For example, a child or pet could come into contact with plants that are still wet, or clothing and other such materials that have high levels of residue present. Following such exposure it is possible for the chemical to enter a person’s body without them ever realizing they have come into contact with the chemical.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn6" name="_ednref6\">[vi]</a> Those that have been mildly exposed to glyphosate have reported irritation in the eyes, throat, and nasal passage. When ingested the chemical can cause increased saliva, burns in the mouth and throat, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and in extreme cases can cause death. Moreover, Glyphosate, when combined with other chemicals, can cause increased toxicity.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn7" name="_ednref7\">[vii]</a> In addition to the cancer-causing effects attributed to Glyphosate, both developmental and reproductive problems have occurred in laboratory studies. These studies found that long-term prolonged exposure to Glyphosate can also impact fetal birth weight and effect fetal skeletal development.<a href=\"index.php?src=gendocs&srctype=detail&id=47#_edn8" name="_ednref8\">[viii]</a> The effects of 4 decades of chemical exposure has taken its toll on the weeds it was meant to destroy and on the bodies of the farmers, foresters and landscapers it was created to assist. In addition, the risk of exposure to the chemical has the potential of reaching not only agriculture workers, but their families as well. If you or someone you love has worked in an industry that places them in contact with Roundup® or any brand of weed killing herbicides containing glyphosate and has developed cancer, or they have spouse or a child that has develop cancer, specifically non-Hodgkin lymphoma their exposure to the chemical may be linked to their diagnosis. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">References</span></strong> "Glyphosate General Fact Sheet".

  blog: '<h3>Mona Lisa Lectures Southern Trial Lawyers on Hog and Coal Ash Lagoons</h3><p>Wallace & Graham Senior Partner, Mona Lisa Wallace, spoke on Saturday, February 25, 2017 in New Orleans at the <i>Southern Trial Lawyers’ Association </i>(STLA) Annual Conference.&nbsp; Ms. Wallace addressed various laws, regulations, and circumstances affecting North Carolina and other Southeastern states and the environment.&nbsp; Her firm has litigation filed on behalf of thousands of residents in eastern North Carolina who have lost the use and enjoyment of their property as a result of stench, flies, and other nuisances associated with animal feeding operations and hog waste lagoons.&nbsp; She also represents hundreds of individuals located whose homes are on-half mile of one of Duke Energy’s unlined coal ash pits.&nbsp; Concerns of the coal ash seeping into drinking water has caused hundreds of residents to drink and bathe from bottled water for nearly two years and to be concerned for their short and long-term health.</p><h3>&nbsp;</h3><h3>Update on Remington 700 Rifle Recall</h3><p>&nbsp;The Conference had many other acclaimed speakers from other southern states including Arthur Bryant, Executive Director of Public Justice, who lectured on the success his organization has had unsealing 118,000 documents related to the Remington 700 series rifle, proving that Remington knew for years its rifle had issues with spontaneously firing but did nothing timely to alert the public.&nbsp; Had Remington disclosed the highly-reported defect associated with trigger mechanism of the 700 rifle sooner, the company could have saved lives. One particularly tragic story is that of the Stringer family from Enon, Mississippi. &nbsp; In 2011, Roger Stringer’s two sons got into an argument wherein Zac, 15, accidentally shot his younger brother, Justin, 11, with his Remington 700 rifle.&nbsp; Zac always claimed to his father that the gun had gone off without him touching the trigger.&nbsp; The father did not believe his son and testified <em>against</em> him in court.&nbsp; Zac was convicted of manslaughter and has served 5 years in prison. The unsealed documents revealed that by 2011 when Justin was killed, the company had received <em>over 200</em> complaints claiming that rifles just like Zac’s with the trigger mechanism called the X-Mark Pro was defective and resulted in spontaneous firing.&nbsp; &nbsp;After this critical information was released to the public, Zac’s father has struggled emotionally with his decision not to believe his son – a decision that led to his son’s conviction.&nbsp; He was interviewed and stated:</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">Q: Is it true that you actually testified against him [Zac] at trial?</p><p style=\"padding-left: 30px;\">A: I did. I did. Because I’d never heard of a gun going off without a trigger being pulled. It made no sense.</p><p>Six months after Justin was killed, 16 year-old North Carolina resident, Jasmine Thar, was killed when a gun owner’s Remington 700 accidentally fired across the street from her house.&nbsp; The bullet traveled across the street, through her sister’s chest, and then directly into Jasmine’s heart.&nbsp; Jasmine died on the spot.&nbsp; The former Marine and experienced hunter next door could not explain how his rifle went off. In April 2014, after the company’s own investigation determined there was a possible assembly error affecting some of the XMP triggers, the company issued an international recall of all Remington products with the XMP trigger mechanisms manufactured from May 1, 2006 to April 9, 2014.&nbsp; However, incredibly, Remington continues to “vehemently” deny allegations of a design defect with its weapon.&nbsp; Remington claims it made a “commercial decision” to settle claims filed against them for improper firing. Despite the rifle being recalled, there remains over 7.5 million Remington 700 and other rifles with this defective trigger in gun owners’ hands. Owners of Remington 700 rifles should <strong>stop</strong> using them.&nbsp; If you own one of these rifles, or know some who does, please encourage them to visit <a href=\"https://www.remingtondocuments.com/" data-saferedirecturl="https://www.google.com/url?hl=en&q=https://www.remingtondocuments.com&source=gmail&ust=1488403010579000&usg=AFQjCNFHOpPNZgf5g-4YYSJZxDHUYoF0mQ\">www.remingtondocuments.com</a>.</p>'

  tag: 'Uncategorized',
  blog: '<p>Last week, after massive state wide recounts, the NC Board of Elections finally certified that Roy Cooper had won the NC Governor’s election. On Monday, December 5, 2016, Pat McCrory conceded the election. McCrory, in a video message, said it was time to <strong>"celebrate our democratic process and respect what I see to be the ultimate outcome of the closest North Carolina governor&apos;s race in modern history."</strong> The people of NC thought we could all finally move on…. But they were wrong. Yesterday the N.C. General Assembly, in a last-minute special session, introduced 28 bills aimed at subverting the will of N.C. voters and limiting the powers of Gov.-elect Roy Cooper. This is an unprecedented, last minute power grab by defeated Gov. Pat McCrory and some Republican legislators, who want to steal the NC governor’s election from the people of North Carolina who democratically elected Roy Cooper. Clearly, Pat McCrory and the NCGA have no interest in celebrating out democratic process or respecting the outcome of this close race, despite what McCrory said just 10 days ago. This attempt to sneakily pass legislation before the holidays – without opportunity for debate and without the public’s knowledge – ignores the will of North Carolina voters. It is quite possibly unconstitutional, but we can’t wait for the NC Supreme Court to decide whether or not these bills are constitutional as the NC General Assembly is also working to pack the NC Supreme Court with Justices who will allow this to happen. We must act IMMEDIATELY to make sure that these sneaky, underhanded bills do not become law. Call your state legislators first thing THURSDAY MORNING and tell them to oppose these bills. Let them know that N.C. voters will not stand for this kind of last minute, crooked politics. Ask them to respect the democratic process, instead of throwing up roadblocks to prevent Roy Cooper from doing the job he was elected to do. Among other things, these bills, if passed would:</p><ul class="list"><li>Allow Pat McCrory, before he leaves office, to appoint a new chairman of the N.C. Industrial Commission. This person would serve a four-year term. The Industrial Commission is the court for workers’ compensation claims, and we expect anyone McCrory appoints to favor big businesses and insurance companies over injured workers.</li><li>Require the incoming governor’s cabinet appointments to be confirmed by the state senate.</li><li>Take away the incoming governor’s power to power to appoint certain State Board of Education and UNC Board of Trustees officials.</li><li>Take away the new governor’s ability to hire and fire some 1,200 political supervisory positions.</li></ul><p>Don’t wait to make your voice heard on this important matter. This special session is expected to close this week, and lawmakers could vote on these bad bills as early as <strong>THURSDAY MORNING.</strong><strong>&nbsp;</strong> If you need help with what to say, consider this:<strong>&nbsp;</strong> <strong><em>This is ______ calling from ______.&nbsp; I am extremely concerned about several bills pending before the General Assembly. Roy Cooper won the governor’s race, and to strip his authority is just wrong.&nbsp; I also oppose the last-minute partisan power grab by Gov. McCrory and certain legislators.&nbsp;North Carolina voters deserve to have their votes count.&nbsp; Can I count on you to vote against rigging this election after the voters have spoken?</em></strong> To find out who represents you in the General Assembly and how to contact them, visit https://www.ncleg.net/representation/WhoRepresentsMe.aspx Also, contact these key legislators to oppose these underhanded bills.</p><ul class="list"><li>Michael Lee:&nbsp; (919) 715-2525 or Michael.Lee@ncleg.net</li><li>Ted Davis:&nbsp; (919) 733-5786 or Ted.Davis@ncleg.net</li><li>Holly Grange:&nbsp;(919) 733-5830 or Holly.Grange@ncleg.net</li><li>Senate President Pro Tempore Sen. Phil Berger:&nbsp;(919) 733-5708 or Berger@ncleg.net</li><li>House Speaker Tim Moore:&nbsp;(919) 733-3451 or Moore@ncleg.net</li></ul><p><strong><em>Please call the legislators below immediately</em></strong> and ask them to respect our democratic process.&nbsp;You can leave a voicemail message after hours. Phone calls are our best chance at stopping these bills from becoming law, but it is also helpful to send an email expressing your opposition. Because the Industrial Commission bill could affect so many of our clients who are injured workers, we also think it is important to make separate phone calls to the committee members who will be voting on it Thursday morning. The Industrial Commission bill has been sent to the Senate Redistricting Committee. To stop it in its tracks please contact these committee members and voice your opposition. All can be reached during through the General Assembly main switchboard at (919) 733-7928 during normal business hours.

  blog: '<p>A powerful blow has just been struck by the Ninth Circuit today, as it’s rejected a corporation’s effort to escape from legal liability by paying off a few individuals to wipe away the claims of thousands. For a number of years now, many corporate defendants have tried to wipe away class actions – even in cases where they’ve broken the law in the exact same way respect to thousands of people – by trying to “pick off” the named class representative with an individual offer of cash. This issue has been to the U.S. Supreme Court twice in the last two years, but both times the Court issued very narrow decisions and did not address the broader underlying constitutional issues. In the most recent case, <em>Campbell-Ewald v. Gomez</em> (<em>Gomez</em>), decided in February (before Justice Scalia’s death), the Supreme Court held in a 5-4 decision that if a defendant made an offer of judgment and the plaintiff didn’t accept it, that a case was not rendered moot. But the Supreme Court left open an “unanswered hypothetical” – it said that it was not saying whether the pick off maneuver would have worked if the defendant had actually placed the money in an escrow account and the district court had entered judgment in favor of the plaintiff.

Turlington, out of Mecklenburg County, the Plaintiff was rear-ended on his motorcycle when he stopped at an intersection to yield to a fire truck. The fire truck was coming towards the intersection with its lights flashing and the siren blaring. The Defendant was directly behind the Plaintiff; however, she claimed that she could not see or hear the fire truck. The trial court sided with the Plaintiff and the Defendant appealed. The North Carolina Court of Appeals agreed with the trial court’s decision giving a verdict to the Plaintiff. The Court stated, “a green light is not a command to go, but a qualified permission to proceed lawfully and carefully in the direction indicated.” The Court also stated that N.C. drivers have a statutory duty yield the right-of-way to emergency vehicles who are giving a signal with lights and audible bells or sirens. When yielding to emergency vehicles, it is also important that you change lanes safely after giving the proper signal. Keep in mind the following three principles: 1) Don’t follow the car in front of you too closely; 2) make sure you pay attention and keep a proper lookout; and 3) yield to emergency vehicles in a safe and reasonable manner. If you feel like you have been in an accident and the other driver did not follow these three principles, you may have a claim and should <a href=\"https://wallacegraham.com/contact-us\">contact a personal injury attorney</a> immediately.</p>'

  blog: '<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A group of animal rights and consumer protection organizations filed suit in federal court this past <span data-term="goog_1970972937\">Wednesday</span> to challenge the constitutionality of the Property Protection Act, better known as the “ag-gag” law. The law passed in 2015 allows employers to sue employees who take photos, video, or any other data from their property without their consent. The lawsuit contends that the law violates the constitutional rights of free speech and civil rights of employees. The law makes it nearly impossible for citizens to legally gather evidence on and report instances of wrongdoing. For example, a farm worker would not be able to document acts of animal cruelty at a farm, or pollution being discharged into a stream. The lawsuit goes on to allege that North Carolina’s House Bill 405 “attacks the core values embodied by the federal and state constitutional protections of speech and press” and “should be declared unconstitutional under the First and Fourteenth Amendments of the United States Constitution.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">North Carolina’s governor, Pat McCrory (R), agreed with some of these claims last year when he vetoed the bill, saying that he was “concerned that subjecting these employees to potential civil penalties will create an environment that discourages them from reporting illegal activities.” However, McCrory’s own party promptly overrode his rejection. Supporters of the new law say it is not aimed at traditional whistleblowers who take their concerns to the proper authorities. Rather, they say, it is aimed at activists who join a company simply to spy and then go to a news outlet with their secret recordings. But, it is clear from the broad language of the statute that the intent was to protect employers far beyond the scenario that they describe. The bill essentially offers employers blanket protection against any employee that documents wrongdoing in the workplace and allows them to seek civil damages against their employee.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">North Carolina is one of seven states that have passed a so called ag-gag law. Most of the laws are centered around the agriculture industry, and are aimed largely at keeping employees or outside groups from photographing or videotaping animal abuse at large farming operations. As the second largest hog producing state in the country behind Iowa, North Carolina’s agricultural industry was certainly motivated to join the others states that had ag-gag laws on the books. But, the impact of the statute will extend far beyond the agricultural community. The law will have implications on nursing homes, hospitals, day cares, group homes, charter and private schools..</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">These laws have been challenged in other states. Last year a Federal District judge struck down Idaho’s ag-gag law, saying it was unconstitutional. We certainly hope that North Carolina’s district court will realize that the legislature cannot undermine the First Amendment.</p>'

  blog: '<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Australian researchers working with the Asbestos Disease Research Institute published a case report announcing significant improvement for a pleural mesothelioma patient treated with microRNA therapy.&nbsp; The results were reported in the&nbsp;American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine. While this is limited to a specific patient these reports are helpful to ongoing research and may also give hope to finding the correct protocol and methodology to cure or at least slow the progression of mesothelioma.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Lawyers and staff at <a href=\"\">Wallace & Graham, P.A.</a> in Salisbury, NC understand that for the individual facing the daunting prognosis of the often fatal disease that slowing down the progression of the disease, even by months, is appreciated by the family. Rhetorically speaking, wouldn’t we all want a few extra months with the ones we love. This type of research may just open the door a little more and with it comes hope.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The researcher’s work is interesting. Following&nbsp;in vitro&nbsp;testing and animal experiments, the researchers used a nanocell delivery platform to provide patients with synthetic mimics of microRNA that had been under expressed in mesothelial tumors.&nbsp; One patient with progressive mesothelioma experienced “a complete metabolic response” as measured by PET scan as well as marked improvement in pulmonary function test results, with some minor side effects.&nbsp; Other patients in the six-person cohort experienced stable disease with one reporting progressive disease.&nbsp; A second cohort is being recruited to determine whether the result is repeatable, further study appropriate dose and investigate the causes for the variability in the results in the first group.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">MicroRNA therapy has the potential to be a paradigm shift in the management of treatment-resistant tumors&nbsp;generally and mesothelioma specifically. While many consider this type of therapy and research in its infancy, it is growing up quickly.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The attorneys at <a href=\"\">Wallace & Graham</a> continue to study and remain familiar with all treatment options for the insidious disease as so many people continue to suffer the result of corporate positions and widespread pollution of the work environment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The FDA’s office of Orphan Products Development granted “orphan drug” designation to some interesting new medications and treatment modalities that may be effective at treating diseases that affect fewer than 200,000 Americans. Mesothelioma fits into this category. In the United States it is estimated that Mesothelioma effects around 3,000 individuals annually. Orphan drug status provides incentives to companies to develop drugs that might otherwise be unprofitable, and a company can use the exclusivity to develop drugs that anyone else might develop but do not have a large affected population. The FDA’s designation gives drug creators grant funding, tax credits for certain research, a waiver of Biologics License Application user fee, and the potential for marketing exclusivity in the United States for seven years.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Development of new medicines, like it or not, continues to be driven, in many cases, by the pharmaceutical companies ability or requirement to profit and to control a market in the niche disease. It is the reality of the situation and the FDA recognizes this factor as one of the necessary incentives by designating certain medications as “Orphan Drugs”.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you are interested in reading the case study please visit the Link at:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"https://www.engeneic.com/content/pdf/a-significant-metabolic-and-radiological-response-after-a-novel-targeted-microrna-based-treatment-approach-in-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma.pdf\">https://www.engeneic.com/content/pdf/a-significant-metabolic-and-radiological-response-after-a-novel-targeted-microrna-based-treatment-approach-in-malignant-pleural-mesothelioma.pdf</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Source: American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine Volume 191 Number 2, June 15, 2015.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;</p>'

  tag: 'Asbestosis & Mesothelioma',
  blog: '<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to research commissioned by the Environmental Working Group (EWG) of Washington, D.C., asbestos fibers and dust were found in four brands of children’s crayons and in toy crime kits.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Manufacturers are using contaminated ingredients from sources, including talc, know to contain asbestos minerals and thus fibers. The history of the crayon is not entirely clear. The word "crayon" dates to 1644, coming from (chalk) and the Latin word&nbsp;<em>creta</em>&nbsp;(earth).</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The attorneys at <a href=\"\">Wallace & Graham P.A.</a> continue to be amazed and befuddled by the evidence that many corporations, long on notice about the hazards of asbestos, simply do not test or screen or even require the out-sourced manufacturer to do so. It is not expensive to test and it is worth the time and effort. How many children create dust when they use, chew, sniff, sharpen, crush or otherwise destroy their colorful crayons creating a potential hazard? We won’t know for decades due to the latency of the disease. Prevention must begin now.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Scientific Analytical Institute of Greensboro, NC, an independent laboratory, tested a total of 28 boxes of crayons. Four of the boxes contained asbestos a known dangerous carcinogen. The crayons were labeled with such popular characters as Disney’s Mickey Mouse and Nickelodeon’s Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles. They do not describe their ingredients or their sources on the package.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Out of the 21 toy crime scene fingerprint kits tested, two came back positive for asbestos. While that may not seem significant one must consider that low level exposures have been shown to lead to the development of asbestos related disease. In young children, who are still growing and developing, this risk is just too great. The crime scene fingerprint test is specifically a powdery dust sprinkled on the fingerprint to highlight the edges of the print. This talc or fingerprint dust, in two sets, contained a carcinogenic dust that is blown off the image and is so light in weight that it is suspended airborne for a long time allowing repeated exposure opportunities.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“This is an exposure that could easily be avoided. The threshold for exposing a kid to a</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">carcinogenic chemical when they’re playing with toys should be zero,” said the EWG’s Senior</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Researcher, Sonya Lunder. The toys essentially contain microscopic asbestos fibers that children may end up inhaling as they use them. The right number of children’s toys that should be contaminated with a carcinogen is zero,” said Sonya Lunder, lead author of the study and senior analyst with the Environmental Working Group</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Amazingly, and against common sense, there’s actually no ban on asbestos being in crayons by the U.S. Consumer Product Safety Commission (CPSC). All of the tested products with the contaminated material were manufactured in China. The manufacturers, instead of taking responsibility and mandating testing by their suppliers, simply try to behave like it’s incredibly tough and expensive to monitor each component of the supply chain for hazards in its product. Profit over people is once again the mantra.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is one more reason the attorneys at<a href=\"\"> Wallace & Graham</a> continue to aggressively hold these companies accountable for the harm they cause. The companies are on notice of this harm yet seem to bury their heads like an ostrich.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Children’s playtime should be filled with fun, not asbestos,” said U.S. Senator Markey Durbin, who asked retailers to voluntarily recall “toxic products” on July 8. “We need greater access to information about where asbestos is present in products children and families use every day.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The CPSC is looking into the investigation’s results, but a lot needs to happen before anything can be done. The probability the asbestos will be a risk to our health is the main item to consider.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Environmental health advocates said there is no safe level of exposure to asbestos, a group of naturally occurring minerals with microscopic fibers. The fibers can accumulate in the lungs and have been linked to cancer and other health problems.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The U.S. Department of Labor also states that there is no “safe” amount of exposure to asbestos. Out of the five distributors of the contaminated products, only Toys “R” Us was willing to reply to TIME Magazine’s request for comment. The company is now “reviewing the referenced report, along with supplier test reports, to ensure full compliance to our strict safety standards.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“The lesson here is that parents can’t just read labels and choose safer products by looking at the labels themselves,” said Lunder. “There’s not enough information about where asbestos might be found.” The group purchased the products in March and April and said it had sent them to an accredited laboratory for testing. It sent samples that tested positive for asbestos to a second lab for confirmation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you or your family have any questions about your legal rights as consumers or for any injury caused by a defective product please do not hesitate to contact the <strong>Attorneys at Wallace & Graham P.A. at <a href=\"tel:18008495291\">1-800-849-5291</a></strong>.

While promising, there are always exceptions and in numerous mesothelioma victims the treatment is not effective.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Recently researchers from the University of Pennsylvania School of Medicine reported at the American Association of Cancer Research (AACR) 2015 annual meeting in Philadelphia, their findings involving Pembrolizumab, a drug/marketed under the brand name Keytruda.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">When a person is diagnosed with cancer, the oncologist (a doctor who specializes in treating people with cancer) recommends a treatment plan that is most likely to have the greatest benefits and the fewest risks or side effects. That initial treatment, called first-line treatment or first-line therapy, is usually chosen based on what worked best in clinical trials for patients with the same type and stage of cancer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, every person responds differently to treatment. If the first-line treatment does not work, starts but then stops working, or causes serious side effects, an oncologist may recommend a second-line treatment (also called second-line therapy), which is a different treatment that is likely to be effective. In some cases, the patient may be a candidate for third-line therapy or additional rounds of treatment after that.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Twenty-five patients with mesothelioma whose disease had progressed after receiving first-line or standard chemotherapy participated in the study. Researchers administered those patients a second-line treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As to the second-line treatment with Pembrolizumab, results were impressive: Seven patients experienced tumor shrinkage, and 12 reported no tumor growth. Only four patients experienced tumor growth after taking the drug.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">"The 76 percent disease control rate is very promising and represents a signal of efficacy in the treatment of this disease," lead study researcher Dr. Evan Alley said in a press release. "The study has provided an early glimpse of the potential benefits."</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The University Of Chicago Medical Center also recently opened a phase II clinical trial involving Pembrolizumab and malignant Mesothelioma and currently is recruiting new patients. A mesothelioma victim’s physician would need to contact the University Of Chicago Medical Center to see if they qualify for the program.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If admitted to the program, the patients will receive the drug every 21 days for up to 24 months in the absence of disease progression. Researchers are hoping for an estimated 65 patients, including those whose disease has progressed following standard chemotherapy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Currently, there is no FDA Approved Second-Line Therapy and the U.S. Food and Drug Administration regulators have not approved mesothelioma treatment that progresses after firstline therapy, which typically includes a combination of surgery, chemotherapy and radiation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The FDA did approve Pembrolizumab in 2014 for the treatment of metastatic melanoma, a rare form of skin cancer. The drug now is being tested on a variety of other cancers, including mesothelioma.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The attorneys at Wallace and Graham will continue to follow the developments closely as this affects so many of our clients who have been stricken with mesothelioma, in most cases, as a result of corporate misdeeds, cover-ups, and negligence.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In addition to announcing the success of using Pembrolizumab, AACR officials reported the drug&apos;s success in treating lung cancer. It stopped cancer growth in 19 percent of 495 lung cancer patients. The drug unmasks the tumor cells and simultaneously activates the immune system to destroy the foreign cells. Last year, it became the first FDA approved, antiPD1drug on the market.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As the attorney at Wallace & Graham have reported in the past, Immunotherapy is key to stopping progression of the disease and extending the quality of a person’s life. It is the next medical wonder and is helping more and more cancer victims. It is an exciting development and one that will be watched carefully.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Most researchers and oncologists agree the future of cancer care will involve more immunotherapy and less toxic chemotherapy and radiation. It hopefully will have less side effects and less adverse reactions and will be able to help a larger group extend their lives while lessening the pain and suffering.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you or a family member have questions about occupational cancers such as mesothelioma, lung cancer, asbestos or other disease or injuries please do not hesitate to contact Wallace & Graham for a free, no obligation consultation. <a href=\"tel:18008495291\">1-800-849-5291</a> and ask for any of the attorneys.</p>'

The most important holiday to us as a nation should be the Fourth of July. It is our birthdate, our continued pronouncement to the world that the U.S.A. is a country of freedom and liberty. While we spend time preparing for the business of barbecues, parades, reunions, and fireworks, the true significance of this holiday is often overlooked.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Freedom comes with a price and we need to pause for a moment and once again continue to appreciate what we have. Think about how hard it was for our heroes of 1776 to have accomplished what they did…To free a nation from oppression and taxation. Try to reflect on what they lived through and gave up so that we can live as we do today. There were no phones, no radios, and no satellites and yet the heroes overcame a vastly superior army. Medical treatment was in its infancy. Death by infection was common. Against this wall of adversity the young Americans fought on and DECLARED for the world our country’s INDEPENDENCE.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The lawyers and staff here at Wallace & Graham are grateful for the independence of this country. As the lawyers can attest to, the freedoms and rights given to the people of the United States must be protected, must be published, must be shared and must be celebrated. The government must act lawfully or be called to task for overstepping its boundaries. Without the Declaration of Independence, America would not look like it does. It is a diverse melting pot of worldly individuals which strengthens the country everyday with new energy and ideas.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Take some time this weekend, pause for a minute and look back at what this country has accomplished. It is a model other countries try to emulate.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">During the American Revolution the legal separation of the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thirteen_Colonies\">Thirteen Colonies</a>&nbsp;from Great Britain occurred on July 2, 1776, when the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Second_Continental_Congress\">Second Continental Congress</a>&nbsp;voted to approve a resolution of independence, declaring the United States independent from Great Britain.&nbsp;After voting for independence, Congress turned its attention to the Declaration of Independence, a statement explaining this decision, which had been prepared by a&nbsp;Committee of Five, with Thomas Jefferson as its principal author. Congress debated and revised the wording of the Declaration, finally approving it on July 4.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Coincidentally, both John Adams and Thomas Jefferson, the only signers of the Declaration of Independence, later to serve as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/President_of_the_United_States\">Presidents of the United States</a>, died on the same day: July 4, 1826, which was the 50th anniversary of the Declaration. Although not a signer of the Declaration of Independence, but another&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Founding_Fathers_of_the_United_States\">Founding Father</a>&nbsp;who became a President,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Monroe\">James Monroe</a>, died on July 4, 1831, thus becoming the third President in a row who died on the holiday.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calvin_Coolidge\">Calvin Coolidge</a>, the 30th President, was born on July 4, 1872, and, so far, is the only U.S. President to have been born on Independence Day.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stated simply, the Fourth of July is the birthday of America establishing it as a free and independent nation, and the Declaration of Independence, which was approved by the Continental Congress on July 4, 1776, is our nation&apos;s birth certificate.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The holiday is significant for several reasons. The events surrounding this date were unique in the country’s history. America was born as a great and noble experiment. It was without precedent and was in uncharted waters. Never before had any colony successfully broken away from its mother country, especially, in this case, the mother country of England which was the most powerful nation on Earth at that time.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some call it the country’s destiny to be a free separate county. These English "Redcoats" lost the war to the Americans. The Americans were considered a minor league team, yet it was this core group of driven individuals, who were little more than a small band of ragtag farmers-turned-soldiers, who fought desperately for their freedom.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As if this were not enough, another incredible aspect of the Fourth of July is the publishing of the Declaration of Independence. To actually "declare" on paper, for all the world to see, our reasons for desiring to break away from England and to establish ourselves as an independent nation was unheard of-not to mention very dangerous. It was like sending a text message to the world that a new way of living, that a new world full of freedoms from oppression was born.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Declaration&apos;s main point is exquisite in its expression yet powerful in its meaning:</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">"We hold these truths to be self-evident: that all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain inalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness."</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Every true American, regardless of political persuasion, should know the above sentence by heart-and should believe it. These lines were quite revolutionary when first written. We suggest you visit the national archives at this link and read the famous words of a new young country. www.archives.gov/.../<strong>decl</strong>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wallace & Graham cherishes the freedom. We also know it comes with a price. We are always appreciative of the men and women in our military who dedicate their lives to let us continue to declare to the world that the United States of America is the land of freedom and honor. Please give thanks to any of the men and women of our armed forces. They do their job with honor and respect so we can live a life of freedom and a chance to prosper.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have any questions about your rights or freedoms or other legal matter including personal injuries, occupational injuries or disease, invasion of property rights or nuisance, please do not hesitate to call the lawyers at <strong>Wallace & Graham at <a href=\"tel:18008495291\">1-800-849-5291</a></strong>, Please be safe and secure over this holiday period and be sure to look at the nation as a whole and see that looking at the forest through the trees it still is the greatest nation in the world, even with all its warts and scars.</p>'

  blog: '<p>The attorneys at <a href=\"\">Wallace and Graham</a> in Salisbury, N.C. continue to follow the advances in Immunotherapy treatment for cancer. This is cutting edge research that continues to make great leaps forward in helping people battle against cancers, such as mesothelioma, lung cancer and asbestosis and to help their clients improve and hopefully extend their quality of life. In May 2015, during a researchers meeting in Chicago, researchers began to hail what they believe is a potent new weapon in the fight against cancer: the body&apos;s own immune system. An international study recently found that a combination of two drugs that helped allow the immune system to fight the cancer -- ipilimumab and nivolumab -- stopped the deadly skin cancer melanoma from advancing for nearly a year in&nbsp;almost 60 % of the cases. As reported to CNN, melanoma, though a skin cancer, can spread to the lungs, liver, bone, lymph nodes and brain resulting in incurable cancer. Not only should people, especially those who work outside or are otherwise exposed to the sun, get regular checkups but if something unusual is noted on their skin they should immediately get it looked at. The sooner it is noticed the better the chances are of stopping or controlling the spread of the cancer. This recent study plus other studies <a href=\"\">Wallace & Graham</a> has noted in prior articles, show great promise in treating lung cancer. While those involved in the fight against cancer are divided as to just how excited to get over the promise of immunotherapy in battling cancer, they all strive to find a cure and to help their patients and those who will unfortunately, become patients Many of the researchers describe the results as &apos;encouraging,&apos; and &apos;promising&apos; "Immunotherapy drugs have already revolutionized melanoma treatment, and now we&apos;re seeing how they might be even more powerful when they&apos;re combined," said Dr. Steven O&apos;Day, an expert with the American Society of Clinical Oncology. "But the results also warrant caution -- the nivolumab and ipilimumab combination used in this study came with greater side effects, which might offset its benefits for some patients. Physicians and patients will need to weigh these considerations carefully," O&apos;Day told CNN. In the study, 36% of the patients receiving the two-drug combination had to stop the therapy due to side effects. Both drugs are made by Bristol-Myers Squibb, the sponsors of the study. The side effects are holding back some treatments so traditional curative measures, burning the cancer off or taking surgical steps to remove it are still the predominate modality for treating skin cancer. Nell Barrie, a spokeswoman for Cancer Research UK, indicated that much remains to be learned and the new drugs, at this time, would not replace any of the existing cancer treatments. Surgery, Dr. Barrie said, would remain vital. So, too, would chemotherapy and radiotherapy, She noted that researchers had yet to study the long-term survival rates for immunotherapy. The side effects, which stopped 36% of the patients to discontinue the therapy, can include inflammation of the stomach and bowel serious enough to require hospitalization, she said. Other Doctors are more optimistic and forward thinking about immunotherapy which, while advancing rapidly, in the scheme of life, is really still in its infancy. For example, Dr. James Larkin, the lead author of the melanoma study, called the results a game changer. <a href=\"\">Wallace & Graham</a> continues to monitor the development of Immunotherapy with great interest as the firm has a long history of not only advocating for the victims of corporate cancers, such as mesothelioma, asbestosis and lung cancer but also takes pride in staying abreast of the current treatment options. This allows the firm to try and keep its clients fully informed so they can ask and can rely upon their physicians to discuss all the treatment options. Wallace & Graham always recommends, above all else, that cancer victims listen to and rely upon their doctors, like those at Duke Medical Center, who are well versed in the latest cancer treatment options and rely upon the experienced lawyers at Wallace & Graham for explanations of their legal rights. <strong>For a free no obligation confidential consultation or meeting please just call <a href=\"tel:18008495291\">1-800-849-5291</a>.

  blog: '<p>When we can report that eating more chocolate is a healthy habit you know it is a great day. When we can share something as important as reducing your risk for developing heart disease and simultaneously get to suggest you eat more chocolate ,the attorneys here at Wallace and Graham P.A. are having a sweet day. Personal research here at the firm has established that there probably isn&apos;t a more magical substance or ingredient on earth than sweet, dark brown chocolate which has brought smiles to the faces of many for more than 3,000 years. While the attorneys at Wallace & Graham often have to focus your attention on the latest cancer treatments, latest asbestos exposure issues, and latest treatment modalities and other necessary but heavy topics, today, for a moment, we can talk about a study that taste good. We get to talk about an “Eureka’ moment in reducing cardiovascular disease with chocolate, yes the consumption of chocolate!! Today chocolate is consumed in multiple forms such as in candy, cookies, drinks, and cakes -- a development that had&nbsp;raised the question and caused a debate among scientists, doctors, cooks and candy makers about what that consumption of liquid dark gold is doing to our health. Common sense tells us that too much of something so fatty and full of calories is a bad thing but a large number of&nbsp;studies have surprisingly found that dark chocolate can reduce the risk of death from a heart attack, decrease blood pressure and help those with chronic fatigue syndrome. The question for many chocolate lovers has been at what point are you having&nbsp;too much of a good thing. That is, is there an optimal "dose" for chocolate eating? A&nbsp;new study published in&nbsp;the journal&nbsp;Heart&nbsp;on June 15, 2015 looked at&nbsp;the&nbsp;effect of consuming chocolate on long-term health. It involved over 25,000 volunteers and concluded that the answer to how much chocolate can be good for you is -- a lot. Study participants in the high consumption group -- those who&nbsp;ate 15 to 100 grams of chocolate a day in the form of everything from Mars bars to hot cocoa -- had&nbsp;lower heart disease and stroke risk than those who did not consume the confection. For comparison a 0.2 oz. Hershey’s kisses Milk Chocolate has approximate 22 calories per piece while a 1.9 oz. 3 Musketeers chocolate bar has 240 calories. A hundred grams is&nbsp;equivalent to&nbsp;about two classic Hershey&apos;s bars. In terms of calories you&apos;re looking at&nbsp;500-535. To keep this into perspective, the Department of Agriculture recommends men consume 2,000 to 3,000 calories a day depending on their height, body composition and whether they are sedentary or active. This association of the decreased risk with increased consumption in the study was confirmed even after researchers took into account a wide range of risk factors, such as age, smoking, alcohol consumption, physical activity and other variables. "The main message is that you don&apos;t need to worry too much if you are only moderately eating chocolate,"&nbsp;Phyo Myint, a professor at the School of Medicine at the University of Aberdeen and one of the study&apos;s lead authors, said in an interview. Higher levels of consumption were associated with a large number of other positives in the study: lower BMI, waist: hip ratio, systolic blood pressure, inflammatory proteins.&nbsp;As crazy as this sounds but when you compare the consumer of chocolates with those who ate no chocolate, those who ate high amounts saw an 11 percent lower risk of cardiovascular disease and 25 percent lower risk of associated death. Candy stores should frame the study and put it on the wall as this is “good stuff”. The study also noted that more of the participants in the study ate milk chocolate vs. dark chocolate which has long been considered healthier. This might suggest that beneficial health effects may apply to both, the researchers said. "Our results are somewhat surprising since the expectation was that benefits of chocolate consumption would be mainly associated with dark chocolate rather than the commercially available products&nbsp;generally used in a British population which are high in sugar content and fat," the study&apos;s author wrote. Myint explained that chocolate is full of flavonoid antioxidants and that previous studies have shown that intake of chocolate results in improved function of the endothelium, or inner lining of the blood vessels. Chocolate has also been shown to increase HDL or "good" cholesterol and decrease LDL or "bad" cholesterol. One other factor was noted and that was that many of the chocolate bars that were consumed by participants contained nuts as an ingredient and which, by themselves, are known to be good for heart health. While the study found that there&apos;s no need to avoid&nbsp;chocolate in your diet to protect your cardiovascular health, one should also not run out to the candy store and pig out on a pile of chocolate bars. All things need to be balanced. Charles Mueller, clinical assistant professor of nutrition at New York University&apos;s&nbsp;Steinhardt School of Culture, Education, and Human Development, points out that&nbsp;there&apos;s no definitive conclusion about cause and effect and that it&apos;s possible that chocolate eaters engage in&nbsp;other behaviors or eat other foods that are good for the heart. There is still more to learn and hopefully we will all receive the invite to participate. "Cocoa beans are not unlike red peppers, green peppers and broccoli and stuff like that. They are full of phytochemicals that are good for you. But if you are overweight, and you are thinking of protecting yourself by eating chocolate you are being kind of silly. Chocolate is just&nbsp;one small element in a full range of a good diet," Mueller said. The attorneys at <strong>Wallace & Graham</strong> are always staying up on the latest developments in Research and thought its clients and friends would enjoy this latest development.

  blog: '<p>Each year, millions of Americans elect to take “early retirement” benefits starting at age 62.&nbsp; When someone who is 62 (or close to it) becomes disabled, they often ask “should I just take the easier route and elect for early retirement benefits or apply for disability?”&nbsp; This is one of the most frequent questions we get and is one that everyone in this situation should consider.&nbsp; The answer is often “yes” to both. Early retirement benefits are typically less, as much as 30% less, than the “full” retirement (age 66+) or disability benefit.&nbsp; Often, if an individual is 62 or very close to it, it makes the most sense for this individual to apply for both disability benefits <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">and</span> to elect for early retirement assuming that individual does not plan to work any longer.&nbsp; As long as you can prove you became disabled <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">before</span> you elected for early retirement benefits, Social Security can award disability benefits retroactively and pay you the difference between the two benefits upon eligibility. In addition, if an applicant only elects for early retirement benefits, his or her Medicare benefits will not begin until the standard age of 65.&nbsp; However, if that same applicant applied for and got awarded disability benefits, he or she would become Medicare-eligible earlier – typically about two years following the date the applicant became entitled to benefits. If you are considering applying for <strong>Social Security disability benefits</strong>, it is very important to discuss your decision with an attorney experienced in these matters.&nbsp; If you wish to speak with one of our attorneys, please call our office at <a href=\"tel:704-633-5244\">704-633-5244</a>&nbsp;for a free consultation.</p>'

Pembrolizumab was safe, tolerable, and yielded robust antitumor responses in patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma, according to data from the phase Ib&nbsp;clinical trial. The test results were very encouraging and continues to represent hope in successfully combatting Mesothelioma, a disease caused by exposure to asbestos materials. While the name of the drug may be a tongue twister its potential success is a blessing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Malignant pleural mesothelioma is a rare form of cancer that arises in the outer lining of the lungs and internal chest wall. With a median survival of only about one year, there is a clear need for new treatment options,” said&nbsp;Evan W.

This is extremely exciting. <a href=\"\">The lawyers at Wallace & Graham</a>, who represent victims of asbestos exposure, are vigilantly reading the latest research and case studies as the firm continues to educate and inform its clients and their families of the latest medical news.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to the researchers, the drug was successful in either slowing the spread or shrinking malignant pleural mesothelioma tumors in 76 percent of patients participating in the study. The disease primarily attacks the lining of the lungs and abdomen although it also affects the lining of the heart in some instances. The only known cause of pleural malignant mesothelioma is the inhalation or ingestion of asbestos fibers.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The research team was comprised of scientists from the United Kingdom, United States and Europe. Of the 25 patients who were given Pembrolizumab seven of them experienced shrinkage of tumors. The drug, according to the results of the study, halted tumor growth in 12 patients. The disease progressed in four patients and two others had not been assessed at the time the study was released. There were no adverse events reported by any of the patients.</p> <p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While the drug shows promise, it is only one aspect or modality for treatment.

That problem may now be solved but time will be the true judge.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">"The attraction of this test lies in its non-invasiveness, ease of use, rapid predictiveness, and potentially low cost,"&nbsp;says&nbsp;author Professor Hossam Haick, Department of Chemical Engineering and Russell Berrie Nanotechnology Institute, Haifa, Israel.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;The attorneys at Wallace & Graham continue to study the latest research, technology and modalities of treatment so that they remain knowledgeable in order to help their clients stricken with cancer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;The latest study involved 484 individuals who gave breath tests after 12 hours of abstention from smoking for a minimum of three hours. About 100 participants were already diagnosed with gastric cancer; however, they were not treated with radiotherapy or chemotherapy. Stopping smoking immediately is always an action that reduces risk of numerous types of cancers.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">All the participants revealed their true drinking and accurate smoking habits. The participants were also tested for Helicobacter pylori infection, which is a known risk issue related to stomach cancer. The scientists are required to have a reliable group of participants to accurately make their findings.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The researchers’ first analyzed breath samples of the participants with the help of a technique called GCMS, which measures several instable organic compounds in an individual&apos;s exhaled breath. Then the researchers conducted another breath test with nanoarray analysis that was combined with pattern recognition. It is a farily objective test.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The results of GCMS reflected that patients without the disease and the ones with stomach cancer had unique "breath prints." It is amazing to realize how the body works and what it does when stricken with illness. It is like looking at ones fingerprints. Unique to each other yet has common structure and other measurable factors.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">GCMS identified 130 organic compounds in the exhaled breath of individuals; however, the intensity of 8 organic compounds differed significantly in participants who had suffered stomach cancer compared to those who were at risk of the cancer. This was the “eureka!” moment in this study.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The nanoarray analysis accurately distinguished between different pre-cancerous phases, marking out patients who were at a high or low risk of getting gastric cancer. Nanoarray is defined as an <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/array\">array</a> of <a href=\"https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/nanosized\">Nanosized</a> objects; especially one of nanosized spots that have unusual optical characteristics. This means they are able to monitor and analyze the characteristics of your breath.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The study suggests that the capability of nanoarray analysis to accurately identify individuals at high or low risk will avoid unnecessary endoscopies. Doctors will also be able to monitor progression of the disease with the help of the breath analysis.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Stomach cancer is not very common but routinely it is confused with other gastric problems. The disease, if undetected and if left until it develops into its later stages the survival factor of the patient is greatly reduced. A simple breath analysis will help thousands of people get screened for stomach cancer at early stages.

  blog: '<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The arsenal continues to grow for doctors who dedicate their life and minds to rid us of cancer. One more tool for their holster is showing great promise. The “liquid biopsy” is an amazing tool and most likely will be used in large scale applications very soon. Many recent developments have been seen in cancer detection and diagnosis. The new technique holds such promise and is a very simple and easy technique.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Researchers and scientist have developed a technique called liquid biopsy, which is a blood test that will diagnosis cancer. The liquid biopsy is a blood test that has become feasible with the latest exquisitely sensitive techniques. The way this technique works is very simple; it will detect the tiny snippets of cancer DNA in the patient’s blood.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this technique only a blood sample is taken for diagnosis and is very safe compared to the traditional cancer diagnosis techniques like the traditional biopsy or a CT scan. The hope is that a simple blood draw, which is far less burdensome for patients than a traditional surgical biopsy or a CT scan, will enable oncologists to quickly figure out whether a treatment is working and to continue monitoring the treatment in case the cancer develops resistance. It allows doctors to have a more precise status of the disease and any failing treatments or protocols could be abandoned quickly, sparing patients grueling side effects. This will give doctors the option to try alternative treatments.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Researchers said, “This could change forever the way we follow up not only response to treatments but also the emergence of resistance.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The scientists have indicated that extensive evaluations are needed to confirm the efficacy of the blood test, but they say that they conducted small studies considering colon, lung and blood cancer, and the earlier results are quite encouraging.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A National Cancer Institute study published this month in The Lancet Oncology, involving 126 patients with the most common form of lymphoma, found the test predicted recurrences more than three months before they were noticeable on CT scans. More than three months! That is an eternity for cancer victims and will allow a much more aggressive treatment plan based on the individuals timetable versus a standard or general protocol treatment. The liquid biopsies also identified patients unlikely to respond to therapy. The researchers were able to predict the recurrence even faster than by the traditional CT scan.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The liquid biopsies could also help researchers identify the patients who are more likely to respond to therapy. Researchers say, “Every cancer has a mutation that can be followed with this method, it is like bar coding the cancer in the blood.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The standard detection techniques for cancer to determine the effectiveness of the treatment are quite vague as it relies on the improvement of patient’s symptoms, but these improvements vary with every individual, so it is not very reliable.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sometimes it also happens that the doctors think the tumor is present when it has gone.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The idea for the test grew out of a discovery made years ago about fetuses: they shed little pieces of DNA into the bloodstreams of mothers-to-be. It turned out that all growing cells, including tumors, shed tiny DNA fragments. “If you find DNA and tell the patient there is a very high risk of recurrence, that creates a lot of anxiety,” Gibbs said. “And we are not sure chemotherapy will be helpful.” The blood test, they hope, will answer that question.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Experts say, “When you are treating a patient — and we see this many times — your treatment is quite effective but there is some residual lesion on a scan, you take the patient to surgery for a biopsy, and all you see is scar tissue. There is no visible cancer there.” This is common because there are chances that it is recurrence.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The attorneys at Wallace & Graham, who routinely represent mesothelioma victims, are always nervous for their clients who have had a surgery to remove the mesothelioma. All of the survivors have routine follow-ups to monitor the status of their disease. When the standard diagnostic testing for recurrence is inconclusive and the diagnostic tools indicate it may be scar tissue or it may be recurrence, the client and their family become worried and psychologically feel like every day will be the day they are told the disease is back. The psychological benefit of early detection with a “liquid biopsy” along with the possibility for immediate implementation for treatment and hopefully a cure are great. This psychological benefit factor cannot be overlooked.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The liquid biopsy could also be more efficient than a CT scan, which can take weeks or months to register tumor shrinkage. Dr. José Baselga, physician in chief and chief medical officer at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mskcc.org/\">Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center</a>, said, “I cannot do a weekly liver biopsy and see how things are going, but I can do a blood test every week.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wallace & Graham attorneys will continue to monitor the development of this exciting field and will continue to share those here on the website.

  blog: '<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">On April 6, 2015, the United States Supreme Court denied reviewed of a petition filed by CashCall, Inc. asking it to review a decision by the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals denying arbitration. The plaintiff, Abraham Inetianbor, received a loan from Western Sky, a South Dakota company, which offered small loans at excessively high interest rates. Under the terms of the loan, Mr. Inetianbor was to repay the loan at an annual interest rate of 135%. Because Western Sky was owned by a member of the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribe, the loan agreement states that by signing it Mr. Inetianbor agreed to have any disputes resolved by arbitration before the Tribal Court. Arbitration is a way to resolve a dispute out of court. But there is no jury and most decisions by the arbitrator cannot be appealed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In this case, the problem was the Tribe does not conduct arbitration and does not have any arbitration rules.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mr. Inetianbor decided to sue CashCall, Inc, the company who took over the loan by Western Sky, because he had paid back the full amount of the money he borrowed plus some of the interest. CashCall insisted he pay back all of the interest owed, which was a lot of money because of the high interest rate. After Mr. Inetianbor filed the lawsuit in federal court in Florida, CashCall tried to have the case dismissed so that it could be arbitrated before the Tribal Court. As mentioned above, the problem was the Tribe did not conduct arbitration and there were no rules for the parties to follow.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The judge initially ordered that the case had to be arbitrated. But thanks to the efforts of Mr. Inetianbor, who, on his own, uncovered the fact that the Tribe does not the conduct arbitration, and the hard work by attorneys at Wallace & Graham who filed motions asking the court to reconsider its earlier decision, the federal judge ultimately ruled in plaintiff’s favor and concluded that arbitration was not possible.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">CashCall appealed the decision to the Eleventh Circuit Court of Appeals. Several attorneys at Wallace & Graham wrote the brief on Mr. Inetianbor’s behalf and attorney, John Hughes, argued the plaintiff’s position to the appellate court. The Court ruled in favor of Mr. Inetianbor. It concluded that because loan agreement required the Tribe to arbitrate using its consumer dispute rules and that these were important parts of the loan agreement, arbitration was unavailable. There was no way for the parties to comply with the terms of the loan agreement because the Tribe did not conduct arbitrations and it did not have any rules on arbitration. This was a huge victory for consumers because courts typically will order arbitration if the parties contract contains an arbitration clause.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;CashCall then asked the United States Supreme Court to hear the case and decide whether the Eleventh Circuit was wrong in holding that arbitration was unavailable in this case. Mr. Inetianbor, through its attorneys at Wallace & Graham, filed a brief opposing the petition. Wallace & Graham argued that the Eleventh Circuit correctly held that arbitration was unavailable in this case and that Mr. Inetianbor should be allowed to pursue his claim in federal court.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The United States Supreme Court ruled in favor of Mr. Inetianbor by refusing to hear the case. As a result, the case was remanded back to the federal court in Florida for trial. This was another great victory for Mr. Inetianbor and Wallace & Graham, who has fought hard for the rights of consumers to have their cases heard in a court of law.</p>'

An insurance policy is considered a contract between you and your insurance carrier. Every insurance contract includes an implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Bad faith claims can arise when an insured submits a claim under their insurance policy. This can be a claim under a homeowner’s policy (e.g. for water damage, or fire loss), under an automobile insurance policy (e.g. collision, medical payments, or comprehensive), or under numerous other policies.

  blog: '<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Supreme Court Takes Bite out of Dental Board Regulations</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The U.S. Supreme Court takes the Bite out of the Powers of the North Carolina Board of Dental examiners to regulate Teeth Whitening and shines a light on this type of Boards limitations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The&nbsp;decision&nbsp;in North Carolina Board of Dental Examiners v. Federal Trade Commission&nbsp;dealt a setback to an increasingly common form of regulation. In this case, the dental board tried to exclude non-dentists from the market for teeth-whitening services after dentists complained about the low prices non-dentists charged for teeth whitening.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It sent threatening letters to non-dentists who offered teeth-whitening services and even encouraged mall operators to kick out kiosks used for teeth whitening. We have all seen at the mall the massage therapists, finger nail salons and teeth whitening kiosks. The board, who issued regulations prohibiting teeth whitening by non-dentists, argued that it was immune or protected from antitrust laws since it was delegated the authority by the state legislature. Dentists wanted to regulate teeth whitening so it could keep the highly profitable treatment in its practice areas.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">State action antitrust immunity</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since 1943, certain forms of state action (regulators) have been immune or protected from the antitrust laws. Antitrust laws are meant to encourage and promote competition in business for the benefit of the consumer. Accordingly, state legislatures may pass laws, knowingly or even unwittingly, which have anticompetitive effects. In this case the Board attempted to regulated this practice and protect it practice and profits from non-licensed competitors. Several important Supreme Court cases since then have addressed the doctrine of state action immunity and helped to define its principals, particularly as it applies to actions of board that are not part of the state legislatures. The Attorneys At Wallace & Graham P.A. in Salisbury NC at 1-800-849-5291 would be happy to discuss this opinion with you should you have any questions regarding its application to your situations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Dental Board</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In North Carolina, the legislature delegated regulation of dentists to a dental board. By state law, practicing dentists must fill a majority of the seats on the dental board.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This type of “self-regulation” is common among state licensing boards and has a natural tendency to protect dentist interests and profits from being infringed upon by non-dental businesses.’ Members of this type of board made up primarily of active dentists frequently try to keep insiders in, keep outsiders out, and prop up the actions and profits of the Dental profession. A broad range of modern professions fall under professional licensing boards, including not just doctors, lawyers, and dentists, but also interior designers, real estate agents, floral designers, and hair braiders.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The dental board’s actions were not supervised by any state officials from North Carolina other than the members of the dental board itself. On these facts, the FTC took action against the dental board.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">No immunity for the dental board controlled by dentists</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Supreme Court, on February 25, 2015 affirmed the lower court and ruled that the dental board is not immune from the antitrust laws. The Court’s opinion explained its findings and ruled that even though the dental board is an agency of the state, its actions must still be supervised by the state in order to enjoy antitrust immunity. Words alone do not make a board immune from lawsuit or challenges to its authority. The “formal designation given by the States” does not itself create immunity.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In North Carolina the board is controlled by market participants (active dentists who want to protect their practices) in the same occupation that the board regulates. The Court stated that “when a State empowers a group of active market participants to decide who can participate in its market, and on what terms, the need for supervision is manifest.” This will keep self-dealing and protective action to a minimum.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Which agencies get antitrust immunity?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The requirement of state supervision announced in today’s opinion applies to agencies “controlled by active market participants.” Actions taken by boards with no involvement from market participants may not have to satisfy that requirement. The opinion also identifies some factors concerning adequate state supervision. For example, the state supervisor must actually review the substance of the agency’s actions and have the power to overrule or modify the actions.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Attorneys at Wallace & Graham P.A. in Salisbury NC at 1-800-849-5291 would be happy to discuss this opinion with you should you have any questions regarding its application to your situations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The dissent disagreed and would have ruled that the Dental Board is an agency that is a state actor and thus immune or protected from Challenge</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Justice Samuel Alito, joined by Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas, dissented or disagreed with the majority. They noted that the practice of self-regulation by dentists in particular predates the Sherman Act in the 1800s. There is nothing new or novel about it. Justice Alito then explains that the agency should get immunity as a state actor because North Carolina made the active decision and designated the dental board as a state agency. He reasons courts should not wade into determining whether a state agency is sufficiently independent to get immunity without being actively supervised by another state official or entity.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Please feel free to call the Attorneys at Wallace & Graham P.A. for any questions about this opinion or for any other legal question you may have.

This is just another example of why it is important to inform the public of the dangers companies like Trinity Guardrails want to keep buried. If you have been injured by this product please call the experienced attorneys at Wallace & Graham P.A. at 1-800-849-5291 for a free no obligation private and confidential consultation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">To understand the importance of your right to know by having open access to court records we will briefly talk about the case and how the fantastic open records ruling was made. As with most defective products it all started with an accident in which the injuries were magnified and more severe due to the defective Trinity Guardrail system. Similar serious accidents multiplied and the problems with the Trinity Guardrails caught the attention of witnesses and also federal and state governments.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At least 42 states and the District of Columbia have suspended installations of the Trinity Guardrails system, some of them based partly on the study of Trinity’s ET-Plus guardrail end terminal, which is designed to absorb the impact of a crash. The study found that the device was almost four times more likely to be involved in a fatal crash than its predecessor model. This resulted in product liability litigation for the injured and also whistleblower litigation to try to, not only, stop the practice, but let the public know of the companies actions to suppress the defects and changes from the public and the government agencies.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We have all observed these devices on the highway as we travel at 60 or 70 miles per hour. The Trinity Guardrail end terminal devices are located at the beginning of almost every interstate guardrail segments with the reflective yellow tape announcing its presence. The Trinity Guardrail, if built to the government standard, was designed to absorb the impact of collisions and slow the vehicle so that the occupants of the vehicles are not injured by the guardrails themselves.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There have been numerous reported instances of the defective version of the Trinity Guardrails, which were built too strong and without sufficient flexibility, actually penetrating the doors of vehicles like a metal spear. The company is accused of many things including changing the design without telling anyone and using cheaper steel that lacked the elasticity and flexibility to crumple and absorb the power of the impact without penetration of the vehicle. Basically the company made its signature Trinity Guardrails protector too strong and inflexible and thus unsafe.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The company, clearly fearing the effects of bad publicity and the negative impact such a finding could have on its bottom line tried with all its might to keep all the records sealed from the public and the government. Allegedly, they did not want people to find out how they manipulated the data and sold a defective product without telling anyone.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">THIS ALL CHANGED ON MARCH 2, 2015. The District Trial Court in the massive whistleblower lawsuit against Trinity Guardrails—<em>U.S. ex rel. Harman v. Trinity</em>— unsealed THE ENTIRE COURT FILE, which contained hundreds of sealed pleadings and exhibits relating to a dangerous highway guardrail that has been linked to dozens of deaths and injuries.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;The court also held that <em>all </em>of the testimony and exhibits from a recent trial of the case must also remain open to the public, effective immediately.&nbsp;The court&apos;s ruling is the culmination of years of effort to hold Trinity accountable for its actions.&nbsp; In October 2014, a jury returned a verdict of $175 million against Trinity for lying to the federal government about secret design modifications to the company’s popular guardrail end terminal—the ET Plus—that has been linked to dozens of deaths and serious injuries.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the wake of that decision, 42 states have withdrawn the ET-Plus from their approved products list, and dozens of personal injury victims and governmental entities have filed suit against Trinity.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;But Trinity is still denying that there is anything wrong with the ET-Plus, and it&apos;s been aggressively attempting to get the jury verdict overturned and to keep the court records under wraps.&nbsp; <strong>The court denied all of Trinity&apos;s arguments and ordered that everything be unsealed – <em>everything</em>.</strong></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wallace & Graham P.A. is proud of the work done by the trial attorneys who care for consumers and fight on their behalf every day. These exceptional attorneys, on behalf of the Center for Auto Safety and the Safety Institute, had urged the court to unseal the records because they contain important safety information on the dangers of a popular Highway guardrail end terminal, the ET-Plus.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Ruling from the bench on March 2, 2015, the Honorable Judge Rodney Gilstrap of the Eastern District of Texas emphasized the importance of the public&apos;s presumptive right of access to court records and chastised Trinity for failing to make any real showing that secrecy was warranted.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Trinity is sure to challenge this decision to the Fifth Circuit, but we believe that the decision is likely to withstand any appeal.&nbsp; Absent a contrary ruling from the Fifth Circuit within 10 days, the public will finally be able to know the whole truth about the ET-Plus.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you believe you or someone you know was injured as a result of the Trinity Guardrail system and you want to know your rights and remedies please call the experienced attorneys at Wallace & Graham P.A. at 1-800-849-5291 for a free no obligation private confidential consultation.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">We handle all types of injury claims and you are always welcome to give us a call on this or any other legal issue.

  blog: '<h3>Large employers too often try to take advantage</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In today’s economy, large employers too often try to take advantage of their employees and deny them legitimate opportunities to take time off to care for themselves or their families.&nbsp; There are two Federal laws meant to ease that burden and provide some protection. The two Federal laws provide certain class of employees with the tools to take care of themselves and their families without losing their jobs.&nbsp; Wallace & Graham Law Firm is well versed in the specifications and requirements of these proactive Federal laws and for your convenience provide this quick review and comparison of these two important federal laws.</p><p>As always, if you have questions call the experienced attorneys at Wallace & Graham PA and we can talk about you and your families’ options.</p><h3>Introduction</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, the general purpose of the Americans with Disabilities Act (Hereinafter the “ADA”) is to prohibit discrimination against disabled individuals.&nbsp; It only applies to the disabled person and does not extend to the family.&nbsp; However, the Family Medical Leave Act (Hereinafter the “FMLA”) provides leave or time off without pay to employees to help protect their job while away from work for certain protected reasons.</p><h3>Who Is Eligible For Protection?</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">ADA Candidates are individuals with a qualifying disability as defined or listed in the statute.&nbsp; Protection of the FMLA extends to employees who have worked for at least 12 months and at least 1250 hours during the previous 12 months at a location within a 75-mile radius of where at least 50 employees work.&nbsp; We know this sounds burdensome or difficult and it admittedly requires some technical application. That is why it is important to give the attorneys at Wallace & Graham a call so we can discuss your rights. Generally most full time employees will be deemed eligible so long as the other conditions are met.</p><h3>What Conditions Are Covered?</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ADA covers a “Disability” that substantially limits one or more major life activities (or a history or perception of having such a disability) &nbsp;The FMLA requires a “Serious health condition” of the employee or certain close or dependent family members of the employee and also applies to certain military related leave.</p><h3>What Leave Is Required?</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ADA provides for “Leave” for only the employee and in certain case it may be required if the “Leave” or time off would constitute a “reasonable accommodation” that does not impose undue hardship on the employer.&nbsp; Leave typically must be for a defined period and is unpaid unless the employer pays for other similar leaves.&nbsp; The FMLA provides unpaid leave up to 12 weeks a year for serious health conditions and up to 26 weeks a year for certain military-related leaves.&nbsp; “Leave” may be intermittent and is unpaid but the employer can require or the employee can choose to use accrued paid benefits. &nbsp;This means the employee may be required to use up or exhaust all vacation, sickness, and personal time off first.</p><h3>What About Benefits?</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ADA does not provide or compel any compensation or sickness benefits.&nbsp; The thrust of the law is that it places a prohibition of discrimination based on disability and is looking for reasonable accommodations that allow the disable to perform their job duties.&nbsp; The FMLA does not provide for benefits and benefits typically do not accrue during leave, but seniority, service time, and vesting continue.&nbsp; The employer may require use or exhaustion of certain paid leaves depending on the specific type of applicable FMLA leave.</p><h3>What about Reinstatement?</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ADA provides that if leave is required as a reasonable accommodation, the employer generally must keep the employee’s position open during the leave.&nbsp; The FMLA generally requires that the employee must be reinstated to the same or a substantially equivalent position.</p><h3>What about Light Duty?</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The ADA specifically states that employers are not required to remove essential job functions as an accommodation, but if an employer reserves light duty jobs for workers’ compensation purposes, it may have to offer such jobs to disabled individuals.&nbsp; The FMLA prohibits an employer from requiring FMLA-qualifying employees to work light duty.&nbsp; It is meant to provide time away from the job to assist the individual or family member during their time of crisis.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">There are some tricks and exceptions to the FMLA and the ADA and in certain situations’ the two can work together to actually extend the 12 week FMLA leave. This is one more compelling reason to contact the experienced lawyers at Wallace & Graham for a complete understanding of you rights can be essential and even crucial.</p><h3>What Are The Remedies?</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Both laws do provide some remedies.&nbsp; The potential penalties with the ADA include compelling lost wages or back pay, compensatory damages, punitive damages, and attorneys’ fees.&nbsp; The FMLA is more limited to simply back pay, reinstatement, benefits, and attorneys’ fees.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This short comparison is meant to simply inform you of potential legal protection should, unfortunately, the situation arise in your life. It is not meant to give legal advice on your specific situation and to protect yourself it is in your best interest to call the experienced attorneys at <a href=\"contact-us\">Wallace & Graham in Salisbury</a> to set up a no obligation consultation in which we can better explain the respective laws that apply to your situation.</p>'

  blog: '<h3>FAKE UNSAFE SUPPLEMENTS ARE ON THE MARKET.</h3><p>Quality control should not be a fictional term for major retailers hawing the equivalent of snake oil. Supplements must be as promised and advertised for otherwise people&apos;s lives and health are directly at risk.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Attorney General for New York recently announced that he sent letters to four major retailers, GNC, Target, Walmart, and Walgreens, for selling store brand herbal supplement products &nbsp;that either could not be verified to contain the labeled substance, or which were found to contain ingredients not listed on the labels.&nbsp; The letters called for the retailers to immediately discontinue the sale of certain popular products, including Echinacea, Ginseng, St. John’s Wort, and others.&nbsp; The Attorney General requested the companies provide detailed information relating to the production, processing and testing of herbal supplements sold at their stores, as well as set forth a thorough explanation of quality control measures in place.&nbsp; It was reported shortly afterwards that many of the involved retailers pulled the alleged defect goods off the shelf until the issue is resolved.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Class action lawsuits are being filed. If you have any of the affected supplements please discontinue using them and seek medical assistance if you are having a current medical concern you believe is related to the counterfeit supplements. Do not throw the counterfeit product away as this is your only evidence and will be important if, as a result of the product use, you have been injured or become sick. This includes allergic reactions or otherwise had your health affected. Store the product in its original container in a bag and keep in a safe dry place. If you have been affected by the fake and counterfeit supplements please immediately contact the experienced attorneys at Wallace & Graham at <a>1-800-849-5291</a>. We will advise you immediately what to do and how to go about protecting yourself.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The evidence the supplements are counterfeit supplements appears to be very strong and frankly, almost overwhelming. &nbsp;DNA testing was performed as part of an ongoing investigation by the Attorney General’s Office. The testing showed that, overall, just 21% of the test results from store brand herbal supplements verified DNA from the plants listed on the products’ labels — with 79% coming up empty for DNA related to the labeled content or verifying contamination with other plant material.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">&nbsp;The retailer with the poorest showing for DNA matching products listed on the label was Walmart.&nbsp; Only 4% of the Walmart products tested showed DNA from the plants listed on the products’ labels.&nbsp; Only 4%. Think about that number and the volume of counterfeit supplements it put in peoples bodies. Walmart is one of the biggest sellers of these items in North Carolina and if you think you have a defective vitamin or supplement please give us a call at Wallace & Graham to discuss your rights.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“This investigation makes one thing abundantly clear: the old adage ‘buyer beware’ may be especially true for consumers of herbal supplements,” said Attorney General Schneiderman.&nbsp; "The DNA test results seem to confirm long-standing questions about the herbal supplement industry.&nbsp; Mislabeling, contamination, and false advertising are illegal.&nbsp; They also pose unacceptable risks to especially those with allergies to hidden ingredients.&nbsp; At the end of the day, American corporations doing business must step up to the plate and ensure that their customers are getting what they pay for, especially when it involves promises of good health.”&nbsp; Many times these companies simply rely upon vendors to make and package the supplements and do not even randomly test to confirm that the consumer is getting what it paid for.&nbsp; In North Carolina the seller can be responsible for its unfit or defective items sold with its brand label. Contact one of the experienced Product Liability Lawyers at Wallace & Graham to discuss your rights. <a href=\"tel:8008495291\">1-800-849-5291</a></p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">States are finally contemplating legislation to create a dietary food supplements safety committee targeting retailers selling generic supplements that may or may not contain the substances contained on the labels.&nbsp; Wallace & Graham has always believed that there needs to be adequate standards and better enforcement over these dietary supplements so consumers will feel confident knowing what they are buying.&nbsp; These companies, if the allegations are true, are selling not only ineffective tablets but also supplements that place individual with allergies at risk of an attack that could result in death.&nbsp; This is a very serious matter and the public needs to be diligent in protecting itself from the retailers whose negligent and possibly fraudulent actions have clearly diluted the value of their name. Until proven otherwise these companies have lost credibility with those seeking the benefit of the supplements.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“The evidence for these herbs&apos; effectiveness is sketchy to begin with," said David Schardt, Senior Nutritionist of the Center for Science in the Public Interest.&nbsp; "But when the advertised herbs aren&apos;t even in many of the products, it&apos;s a sign that this loosely regulated industry is urgently in need of reform.&nbsp; Until then, and perhaps even after then, consumers should stop wasting their money.&nbsp; Attorney General Schneiderman has done what federal regulators should have done a long time ago.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“This study undertaken by Attorney General Schneiderman’s office is a well-controlled, scientifically-based documentation of the outrageous degree of adulteration in the herbal supplement industry,” said Arthur P. Grollman, M.D., Professor of Pharmacological Sciences at Stony Brook University.&nbsp; Hopefully, this action can prompt other states to follow New York’s example and lead to the reform of federal laws that, in their current form, are doing little to protect the public.”</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Using DNA barcoding technology to examine the contents of herbal supplements, the Attorney General’s investigation is focused on what appears to be the practice of substituting contaminants and fillers in the place of authentic product.&nbsp; The investigation looked at six different herbal supplements sold at the four major retail companies. It tested product from various regions so that the samples would accurately reflect the markets the counterfeit goods were being sold in.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The testing revealed that all of the retailers at issue were selling a large percentage of supplements for which modern DNA barcode technology could not detect the labeled botanical substance. A large number of the tests did not reveal any DNA from a botanical substance of any kind.&nbsp; Some of the contaminants identified include rice, beans, pine, citrus, asparagus, primrose, wheat, houseplant, wild carrot, and others.&nbsp; In many cases, unlisted contaminants were the only plant material found in the product samples. That is an incredulous statement. Some of the counterfeit and fraudulent supplements had none of the product. Zero!</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">This is why, if you or your family have been affected you should stop immediately from taking the suspected supplement, preserve it by keeping it in its original container and placing it in a sealable baggie. If you are currently suffering some negative health affect form the medicine seek immediate medical attention. If you have questions on what to do please contact the attorneys at Wallace & Graham to determine your next step.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The U.S. Food and Drug Administration requires companies to verify that their products are safe and properly labeled for their contents, but unlike drugs, supplements do not undergo the agency&apos;s rigorous evaluation process, which scrutinizes everything about the drug—from the design of clinical trials to the severity of side effects to the conditions under which the drug is manufactured.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If the producers of herbal supplements fail to identify all the ingredients on a product’s label, a consumer with food allergies, or who is taking medication for an unrelated illness, is taking a potentially serious health risk every time a contaminated herbal supplement is ingested.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">An expert in DNA barcoding technology, Dr. James A. Schulte II of Clarkson University in Potsdam, N.Y., was hired by the Attorney General’s office to perform the testing.&nbsp; DNA barcodes are short genetic markers in an organism’s DNA and are used to identify it as belonging to a particular species.&nbsp; Barcodes provide an unbiased, reproducible method of species identification.&nbsp; Barcodes can be used to determine the exact plant species being tested. Science proved the products to be counterfeit.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have questions or concerns about your rights pursuant to North Carolina law are with respect to these types of products please contact the experienced attorneys at Wallace & Graham P.A at 1-800-849-5391.

  blog: '<h3>Age Matters</h3><p>One of the most common questions we get from clients who are thinking about applying for Social Security Disability is: does my age affect my Disability benefits?&nbsp; The short answer is yes.&nbsp; In fact, very much so in some cases.&nbsp; To be clear, this is not to dissuade a younger disabled individual from applying for benefits, but simply to illustrate the effect that one’s age can have on his or her application for Disability benefits. The Social Security Administration (SSA) uses many factors to determine whether an applicant is disabled, but one of the initial factors the SSA takes into account is the applicant&apos;s age.&nbsp; If an applicant does not meet a “listing,” which is a per se disabling medical condition (such as an advanced cancer) regardless of age, the applicant&apos;s age then determines the level of analysis used by the SSA to decide if the applicant is disabled.</p><h3>Those levels are as follows:</h3><p>Ages:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Classifications: 18-44 &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Young individual 45-49&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Younger individual 50-54&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closely approaching advanced age 55-59&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Advanced age 60-65&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Closely approaching retirement age 66+&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Retirement age Stated simply, the older the individual, the easier it is to qualify for Disability benefits.&nbsp; The SSA believes that “young” and “younger” individuals can more easily train for another job, perhaps one that is less physically demanding than a prior one he or she can no longer perform due to certain conditions.&nbsp; If he or she can train for and perform the less-demanding or different type job, the SSA is not likely to find that person disabled under the law. Likewise, the SSA recognizes that it could be very difficult for an older individual to train for a new job in which their past work skills may not easily transfer.&nbsp; Therefore, if someone of age 60-65 is unable physically to perform prior work, the SSA will likely find that person disabled even if he or she might could physically do a different, less demanding job. If you are considering applying for Social Security Disability benefits, it is important to first discuss this with an attorney experienced in this field.&nbsp; Should you have any questions, please do not hesitate to&nbsp;<a href=\"contact-us\">contact our office</a>&nbsp;for a free consultation.</p>'

He subsequently repaid $3,252.65 to the servicer of the loan, CashCall, over twelve months. Mr. Inetianbor refused to pay a subsequent bill from Cashcall because he believed his financial obligations had been fulfilled. CashCall disagreed, and reported Mr. Inetianbor’s purported default to credit agencies. Mr. Inetianbor then sued, inter alia, for defamation and usury violations.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The loan agreement mandated any dispute be arbitrated by the Cheyenne River Sioux Tribal Nation (the “Tribe”).

The Court looked to “how important the term was to one or both of the parties at the time they entered into the agreement” – to determine whether the arbitration agreement is integral. In this case, the agreement made multiple references to the Tribe. In nine paragraphs regarding arbitration in the contract, the Tribe was specifically mentioned in five of them. The Court concluded that the contract’s use of “shall” and “is required to” was sufficient evidence of the intent to make the Tribal arbitral forum the exclusive forum.&nbsp; Since that arbitral forum was unavailable, Appellant’s motion to compel arbitration was denied.&nbsp; Inetianbor v.

  blog: '<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Cancer Immunotherapy: Body heal thyself!</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It isn’t often one can say that something exciting and positive is happening in cancer treatment but there is good news with immunotherapy. The science and treatments are changing rapidly. What is so amazing is that the source of this change is hidden within our own bodies. Cancer Immunotherapy is at the forefront of the battle to fight and perhaps cure certain types of cancer.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">What is Cancer Immunotherapy and how does it work?</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It is quite complex, but basically Immunotherapy is treatment that uses certain parts of a person’s own immune system to fight diseases including cancer. This can be done a few different ways.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">First, doctors determine how to stimulate your own immune system to work harder or smarter to attack cancer cells. Secondly, doctors are developing drugs that give your immune system components and weapons to use, such as man-made immune system proteins.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Multiple tests and studies are ongoing and reports of positive results continue to trickle in.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since the Late 1800&apos;s</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For a long time, since the late 1800’s, doctors and scientist suspected that a person’s own immune system could affect certain cancers. Even before the immune system was well understood, William Coley, MD, a New York surgeon, first noted that getting an infection after surgery seemed to help some cancer patients. The ability to think outside the box and to always think proactively helped Dr. Coley as he began treating cancer patients by infecting them with certain kinds of bacteria. This came to be known as Coley Toxins.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Although he had some success, his technique was overshadowed when other more drastic forms of cancer treatment, such as radiation therapy, came into use. We have all heard about how awful chemotherapy and radiation are and the side effects they cause including hair loss, fatigue, and loss of appetite to name a few. Hopefully, the new therapy will work better, quicker and be less damaging to the parts of the body that are not infected with cancer.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Thankfully, science and medicine continue to explore immunotherapy. A recent Wall Street Journal article entitled <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/cancers-super-survivors-how-immunotherapy-is-transforming-oncology-1417714379\">Cancer Super-survivors: How Immunotherapy is transforming Oncology</a>, described a growing group of “super-survivors” who are transforming the world of oncology. In both total numbers of survivor’s and time of survival, the super-survivors are charting new territory. They are reviving hopes that the long-maligned idea of enlisting the power of one’s own immune system against cancer may help to turn the tide against some of the most lethal and resistant forms of the disease.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Since Coley’s Toxins were used in the late 1800’s doctors and scientists have learned a great deal about the immune system and how it might be used to treat cancer. Advances are rapid and there are numerous startup companies working in the field. It is complex, highly technical and very expensive. Treatments can total well over $120,000 per treatment and some average $12,500 per month or $150,000 a year. Hopefully the cost will go down as the drugs are developed.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In the last few decades immunotherapy has become an important part of treating some types of cancer. Newer types of immune treatments are now being studied for many other types, and they’ll impact how we treat cancer in the future. Immunotherapy includes treatments that work in different ways. Some boost the body’s immune system in a very general way. Others help train the immune system to attack certain cancer cells specifically. Your immune system is a collection of organs, special cells, and substances that help protect you from infections and some other diseases. Immune cells and the substances they make travel through your body to protect it from germs that cause infections. They also help protect you from cancer in some ways.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Think of Your Body as a Castle</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">It may help to think of your body as a castle. Germs like viruses, bacteria, and parasites are like hostile, foreign armies that are not normally found in your body. They try to invade your body to use its resources, and they can hurt you in the process. Your immune system is your body’s defense force. It helps keep invading germs out, or kills them if they do get into your body. The immune system keeps track of all of the substances normally found in the body. Any new substance in the body that the immune system doesn’t recognize raises an alarm, causing the immune system to attack it. Substances that cause an immune response are called antigens. The immune response can destroy anything containing the antigen, such as germs or cancer cells.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Two Cancer Immunotherapy drugs being developed by major drug companies have proved remarkably effective against blood cancer Hodgkin’s Lymphoma. This adds to the growing evidence of the potential for enlisting the immune system in the fight against a wide range of tumors. The drugs are among an emerging class of agent’s know as immune checkpoint inhibitors which have shown the most promise against skin cancer and Lung cancer.</p><h4 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wallace & Graham is Watching</h4><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Wallace & Graham is watching this closely as we represent victims of asbestos exposure who suffer from lung cancer. We are hopeful this promising research can be used to help our clients survive this occupational disease and are looking to see if it can apply to treatment of mesothelioma.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Tumor cells are very clever and they develop mechanisms that allow them to persist and not be seen effectively by T cells. If you can inhibit that mechanism you are unleashing the “T” cells and you are able to mount an immune response against the tumor.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For more information on this please read the American Cancer Society’s research papers on the latest developments in Cancer Immunotherapy.</p><h5>Sources:</h5><p><a href=\"https://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/treatmenttypes/immunotherapy/immunotherapy-toc\">American Cancer Society-Cancer Immunotherapy</a>.

  blog: '<h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">One of the most common work-related illnesses</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><a href=\"workers-compensation-injury-claims\">Occupational hearing loss</a> is one of the most common work-related illnesses in the United States. Every year, approximately 30 million people in the United States are occupationally exposed to hazardous noise. Noise-related hearing loss has been listed as one of the most prevalent occupational health concerns in the United States for more than 25 years. Thousands of workers every year suffer from preventable hearing loss due to high workplace noise levels. Since 2004, the Bureau of Labor Statistics has reported that nearly 125,000 workers have suffered significant, permanent hearing loss. In 2009 alone, BLS reported more than 21,000 hearing loss cases.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Occupational hearing loss is damage to the inner ear from noise or vibrations due to certain types of jobs. Over time, repeated exposure to loud noise can cause hearing loss.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Some jobs carry a high risk for hearing loss, such as airline ground maintenance, construction and farming. However, any job that involves loud machinery can cause hearing loss. Short term exposure to loud noise can also cause a temporary change in hearing (your ears may feel stuffed up) or a ringing in your ears (tinnitus). These short-term problems may go away within a few minutes or hours after leaving the noisy area. However, repeated exposures to loud noise can lead to permanent tinnitus and/or hearing loss.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Loud noise can also create physical and psychological stress, reduce productivity, interfere with communication and concentration, and contribute to workplace accidents and injuries by making it difficult to hear warning signals. Noise-induced hearing loss limits your ability to hear high frequency sounds, understand speech, and seriously impairs your ability to communicate. The effects of hearing loss can be profound, as hearing loss can interfere with your ability to enjoy socializing with friends, playing with your children or grandchildren, or participating in other social activities you enjoy.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">How do you know if your workplace is too loud?</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Sounds above 80 decibels (dB, a measurement of the loudness or strength of sound vibration) may cause vibration intense enough to damage the inner ear, especially if the sound continues for a long time. To illustrate the different decibel levels:</p><ul style=\"text-align: justify;\"><li>90 dB -- a large truck 5 yards away (motorcycles, snowmobiles, and similar engines range from 85 - 90 dB)</li><li>100 dB -- some rock concerts</li><li>120 dB -- a jackhammer about 3 feet away</li><li>130 dB -- a jet engine from 100 feet away</li></ul><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A general rule of thumb is that if you need to shout to be heard, the sound is in the range that can damage hearing.</p><h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Noise may be a problem in your workplace if:</h3><ul style=\"text-align: justify;\"><li>You hear ringing or humming in your ears when you leave work.</li><li>You have to shout to be heard by a coworker an arm&apos;s length away.</li><li>You experience temporary hearing loss when leaving work.</li></ul><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have to work around loud noises at work, there are several precautions you should take. One of the most important precaution is to wear hearing protection. Hearing protection devices (HPDs), such as earmuffs and plugs can help control exposures to noise although these do not guarantee that you will have no hearing loss.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The main symptom is partial or complete hearing loss. The hearing loss will likely get worse over time with continued exposure. Sometimes hearing loss is accompanied by noise or ringing in the ear (tinnitus). If you have difficulty hearing people or if you keep your television sound very high, you may be suffering from hearing loss.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Hearing loss is often permanent. The loss may get worse if you don&apos;t take measures to prevent further damage. If you believe you have hearing loss contact a medical professional for diagnosis and treatment.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At Wallace & Graham, we represent workers with hearing loss.

  blog: '<h3>Pesticides can Really Bug You</h3><p>In 2011, the National Cancer Institute at the National Institutes of Health published a study of 52,000 farmers and 32,000 wives all of which resided in North Carolina or Iowa looking at cancer risks and other health problems. This study is known as the “Agricultural Health Study” or “AHS”. In particular, the study found increased risks of leukemia, non-Hodgkin lymphoma, multiple myeloma, soft tissue sarcoma as well as cancers of the stomach, brain and prostate. Several risk factors were considered including; pesticides, engine exhaust, solvents and dust. This study is considered to have unique strengthens because of the number of people studied, the information known about those people, and number of years they were studied. The use of pesticides has long been studied regarding the health effects associated with their used. As an example. A 2009 study found that people exposed to week killers containing “imazethapyr” were at an increased risk of developing bladder and colon cancer. This is a common weed killer in soy bean, dry bean and other field crops, all common in North Carolina. Common product names containing “imazethapyr” are; Steel, Lightning, Pursuit and Extreme. Other common weed killers, such as “Roundup” contain a substance “glyphosate” which has been shown to induce the growth of <a href=\"https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23756170\">breast cancer cells</a>. Exposures are not simply limited to individuals directly applying the pesticides. “Indirect environmental exposure is also a significant problem for people living near farms.” Pesticides can travel miles in the air, or contaminant ground water. Studies have shown that pesticides in carpet dust from farming areas can be 10 to 200 times higher than the surrounding air. This can be a significant issue as young children often spend a considerable time on the floor. Additionally, the <a href=\"https://www.sustainableproduction.org/downloads/AgricultureandCancer_001.pdf\">United States Department of Agricultural</a> have estimated that as many as 50 million people drink water contaminated with pesticides and other agricultural chemicals. Because of the hazards that can potentially be associated with the use of some pesticides, the labels often contain numerous precautions. As an example, the label for “imazephyer” discussed above <a href=\"https://www.dupont.ca/content/dam/assets/industries/agriculture/assets/cp_PSD-81_31156-2013-10-09_Imazethapyr_Label.pdf\">contain precautions</a> such as: take a shower “IMMEDIATELY” after work, avoid breathing vapor and mist, wear long sleeve shirt and pants, and avoid contact with eyes, and skin.</p>'

  blog: '<h3>Calculate Your workers&apos; Compensation Rate</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you have a filed workers’ compensation claim, it is critically important to determine your correct average weekly wage and workers’ compensation rate. The general rule for determining a workers’ compensation rate is to take your annual earnings for the full year prior to the work injury and to divide those annual earnings by the 52 weeks in that year and then multiply that number by 66 and two-thirds percent (.667). For example, if you had become injured on November 18, 2014, you take your prior year of earnings (November 18, 2013 through November 17, 2014) and divide that number by 52 and then multiply that number by 66 and two-thirds percent (.667).<strong> [Math using annual income of $35,000 ÷ 52 = $673.08 × .667 = $448.75] See <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-2.htm\"><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">N.C. Gen. Stat. § 97-2(5)</span></a>.</strong> Each year, the N.C. Industrial Commission sets a maximum workers’ compensation rate, and the maximum that applies to your claim will depend on the year you were injured or diagnosed with an occupational disease. See <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/maxrates.htm\">North Carolina Industrial Commission website</a>.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However, there are many important additions and exceptions to this general rule that employees are unaware of. Due to the confusion surrounding workers’ compensation rates, we have developed the following myth busters:</p><h3>Myth #1: My overtime does not factor into my workers’ compensation rate. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">False</span></strong>.</h3><p>Your overtime must be included in your workers’ compensation rate. The inclusion of overtime wages can make a huge difference in your out-of-work earnings or eventual permanent partial disability rating.</p><h3>Myth #2: Only my paycheck earnings are factored into my workers’ compensation rate.<strong> <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">False</span></strong>.</h3><p>The following are benefits that North Carolina courts have determined, in some cases, should be considered as “wages” for the purposes of determining your workers’ compensation rate: 1. Room & Board 2. Per diem pay 3. Company car 4. Bonuses 5. Profit-sharing 6. Commissions 7. Tax-deferred contributions to company retirement accounts NOTE: Employer’s contributions to an employee’s retirement account have generally been excluded by courts.</p><h3>Myth #3: I always have to divide my annual earnings by the 52 weeks in the year prior to my injury. <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">False.</span></strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Besides the <strong>first</strong> and general method detailed above, there are four other methods used by the court to calculate your correct average weekly wage. These methods are considered in sequential order (1,2,3,4,5) by the court.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Second</strong>, if you missed more than 7 consecutive calendar days during your prior year of earnings, those weeks may be deducted from your calculation and not counted towards determining your workers’ compensation rate. <strong>Third</strong>, if your employment prior to the injury is less than 1 year (52 weeks), then you can divide by the number of weeks that you worked, provided that outcome is considered “fair and just”. <strong>Fourth</strong>, if you only worked for a very short period of time before your injury or your employment was casual in nature, you can ask the court to use the earnings of another person in “the same grade and character employed in the same class of employment in the same locality or community” as you. Fifth, if none of the other methods would be considered “fair,” the court or Industrial Commission can use a different proposed method which would most nearly approximate the amount the injured employee would be earning were it not for the injury. This fifth method can be applied in many situations where using the other methods would result in unfair results. <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-2.htm\">Please see N.C. Gen.Stat. 97-2(5)</a> for more information, or contact an attorney that specializes in workers’ compensation.</p><h3>Myth #4: I cannot remember what I earned during the 52 weeks before my injury. I have to just guess my earnings, right? <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">False</span></strong>.</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you request what’s called a <strong><a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/forms/form22.pdf\">Form 22</a></strong>, your employer is required to fill out your prior 52 weeks of earnings, including overtime and all other per diem, bonus, etcetera benefits. Your employer/carrier must sign the Form 22 asserting that the numbers included on the form are a “true and correct statement of days worked and earnings of this employee.” If your employer makes a false statement for the purposes of denying workers’ compensation benefits, it may result in civil and/or criminal penalties!</p><h3>Myth #5: I am a volunteer firefighter injured during that line of work. Is my correct WC rate $0.00? <strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">False</span></strong>.</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Volunteer firefighters, by statute, are given a special exception to the general rule. At a minimum, they are provided with 2/3rds of the maximum weekly benefit amount found on the <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/maxrates.htm\">North Carolina Industrial Commission website</a>. The maximum benefit for an injury occurring in 2014 is $904.00, so two-thirds of that wage totals $602.66.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In summary, calculating your workers’ compensation rate must be done on a case-by-case basis using the specifics of your wages and your unique employment history. In some cases, determining a fair rate can be complex, confusing, and can sometimes require litigation. If you have questions about your correct rate, please contact an attorney or firm that specializes in workers’ compensation.</p>'

  blog: '<h3>Detergent packets are poisoning, on average one child every hour of the day – We cannot let this fact get washed away.</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">A laundry product sold for adult convenience has rapidly become not only a serious and dangerous threat to the safety of small children but is poisoning children at a remarkable rate. Over 17,000 times in two years Poison Control was called with a case of a child being poisoned, says a report in November’s Pediatrics.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Laundry-detergent capsules like the ones popularized by Tide are a serious poisoning risks to young children. This new study calls on manufacturers to make modifications so that the products will be safer. Doctors are trying to remind parents, caregivers and daycare centers to keep these poison packets locked up and away from the reach of small young children. The single-use packets — often called "pods" after the popular Tide Pods brand — sent an average of one child a day to hospitals in 2012 and 2013, the first two years they were widely available in the United States, Roughly once an hour, a child under 6 was exposed to the concentrated detergents in the packets, researchers say. About 4.4% of those children were hospitalized, and one death has been linked to the product with more than 100 cases in which children were put on breathing machines.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Numbers for 2014 are not yet available, but the danger persists, says lead researcher Gary Smith, director of the Center for Injury Research and Policy at Nationwide Children&apos;s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio. Children ages 1 and 2 — old enough to be mobile but too young to recognize danger — are most at risk, he says. "These products are colorful. They can look like candy or juice to a young child." These small young children are injured simply by ingesting a portion of the highly concentrated detergent contained inside the dissolvable packet.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In typical cases, children bite or poke through the thin, dissolvable packet membrane and "get this concentrated squirt of detergent down their throats" or in their eyes, he says. The children tend to get much sicker than those exposed to traditional laundry detergent, Smith says. Vomiting and coughing are common; in rarer cases, comas, seizures and breathing problems occur. There is possible hope. The report noted that calls to poison centers about the products started to decline in late 2013. However data from 2014 will be needed to see if there is a sustained decline. Packaging changes and education efforts by manufacturers, pediatricians and others may have contributed. Since early reports surfaced, some producers and manufacturers added visible warning labels and made packaging harder to open and potentially less attractive to children. However the danger still exists if the packets fall to the floor, are left unattended, or are left reachable at a small child’s level. In any case, the report says, "It is not clear that the pod containers of any brand currently on the market are truly child-resistant." The researchers call for new voluntary packaging standards. An effort to develop such standards is underway and manufacturers are involved in the process, according to a statement from the American Cleaning Institute.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The institute, which represents companies that make cleaning products, says it is important to remind parents and other caregivers to keep laundry packets and all other household cleaners away from children. The study, which was conducted by the Nationwide Children’s Hospital in Columbus, Ohio, should put more pressure on manufacturers to implement more aggressive visible measures to keep your children from being exposed to this dangerous product. Due to its similar color and shape, children appear to mistake the deadly packet as candy.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Doctors told the Wall Street Journal last year that the concentrated nature of the product heightened the risks to children who come into contact with them. Plus, the packets are encased in a dissolvable film and tend to burst when bitten into, shooting the detergent down children’s throats. The doctors were also concerned that the formulation of the products make them more dangerous. Some have pointed to a higher amount of surfactants in the laundry capsules relative to regular detergent as a possible cause. Surfactants are compounds like soap that help oil and dirt dissolve in water and are very strong acting chemicals.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">By comparison children have sampled regular laundry detergent over the years without much incident, since they usually were turned off by the taste before they could ingest enough to cause problems, poison-control experts have said. The concentrated packets provide a large burst of strong acting chemicals. That is the danger. The laundry industry says parents need to be part of the solution. According to a survey by the American Cleaning Institute, just 34% of households store their unit-dose laundry packets in a cabinet or lock it away. Sadly but telling, most people who responded to the survey said they keep the products well within arm’s reach of children.</p><p>Sources: Wall street Journal U.S.A Today Pediatrics Journal</p>'

What is Mesothelioma and what does it mean, what must they do and how soon must they do it, who do they need to see, what are the medical options, and what legal issues must be taken care of immediately?</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">What must the victim do to get all possible treatment to beat the diseases or at a minimum treatment that will reset the clock so they can have as much time as possible with their family and are afforded time to get their affairs in order.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Medical treatment options, legal issues, family issues, estate issues and the loss of the capability to work and provide for the family are all immediately thrust upon the family and the weight of these issues can easily overwhelm. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>Wallace & Graham P.A</strong>.</span> Attorneys can help answer those questions quickly and confidentially and help remove the weight of these issues.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The attorneys at <strong>Wallace & Graham</strong> <strong>P.A</strong>. have over 100 years of combined legal experience in helping the injured and their families through these trying times. <strong>Wallace & Graham P.A.</strong> has helped thousands of families answer these questions and also pursued and secured the victim’s legal rights to compensation for the illness and damages caused by the acts and omissions of the corporations that profited from unsafe asbestos products and services.</p><p>This article just briefly touches on the issues as the disease is complex and the medical and legal options are dependent upon the person’s unique situation.</p><h3><strong>What Must be Done First?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Once diagnosed the victim of the disease is advised by their physician to see a Mesothelioma specialist. This could include the preeminent Mesothelioma surgeons practicing at Duke Medical Center in Durham, NC, Wake Forest Baptist Cancer Hospital in Winston-Salem, NC, Brigham Women’s Hospital in Boston, MA, or other excellent Cancer centers to help determine their options in handling this devastating disease.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Because of therarity of Mesothelioma and the complexities of the situation and diagnosis specialist are the best to help. Due to the requirement and need for special surgical techniques and firsthand experience and knowledge of optimal medical treatment and therapy, cancer treatment in centers with established medical personnel experienced in the management of Mesothelioma have shown better results.</p><h3><strong>What Caused the Illness?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Simple research on the internet informs the family that the cause of the disease was due to their loved ones exposure to asbestos fibers and dust. &nbsp;It is a Signal Tumor for asbestos exposure which means if the victim has the diagnosis of Mesothelioma they are assumed to have been exposed to asbestos. Further study establishes quickly that the illness was the fault of certain corporations that, without providing safety instructions or hazard warnings and without showing concern for the ultimate user or their family, decided to profit by introducing what they knew was an unsafe and deadly asbestos containing product into the market for use by industry.</p><h3><strong>Who is Responsible for Mesothelioma?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Numerous companies that made or sold asbestos containing products, without concern or regret, knew that their products were exposing the worker to a toxic dust and to compound the matter, these culpable companies knew that the asbestos fibers and dust would be carried home by the worker on their clothes, in their vehicles and on their body thereby exposing the household, their children or spouse or other innocent bystanders to the deadly fibers and associated illnesses.</p><h3><strong>What is Mesothelioma and What Does it Mean?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Malignant Mesothelioma is a rare cancer that occurs in the thin layer of&nbsp;tissue that covers the majority of a person’s internal organs (mesothelium).This thin layer is very important to help protect the organs.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mesothelioma is an aggressive and deadly form of cancer. Mesothelioma treatments are available,but sadly,for many people with Mesothelioma,a complete cure is not possible. Instead the doctors try to “reset” the clock to give the person more time to be with their family before the disease runs it lethal course.</p><h3><strong>What Types of Mesothelioma are there?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">DoctorsdivideMesotheliomaintodifferenttypesbasedonwhatpartofthemesotheliumis affected.Mesotheliomamostoftenaffectsthetissuethatsurroundsthelungs(pleura).This type is called pleural malignant Mesothelioma.Other types of Mesothelioma affect tissue in the abdomen (peritoneal Mesothelioma), and around the heart and around the testicles.</p><h3><strong>Can Mesothelioma be Cured?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Encouragingly there are numerous cases of survivors living long past the normal survival rate and this further highlights the need to get to specialists as soon as possible. Some patients will experience long-term survival with aggressive treatment approaches.</p><h4><strong>What are the Medical Options?</strong></h4><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Mesothelioma surgeons have performed different types of surgeries on patients with malignant Mesothelioma. One of the more common types of surgery for Mesothelioma is a surgical debulking followed by post-surgical chemotherapy. With this procedure, a heated chemotherapy agent is directly administered into the affected space immediately after the debulking portion of the surgery. This new approach to Mesothelioma treatment is also referred to as cytoreductive surgery (debulking) plus perioperative chemotherapy. Hundreds of patients have now undergone this procedure and results have been reported by the National Cancer Institute (USA). It is important you talk to and get all medical options explained to you from your physician as this article is only for informative purposes and not for purposes of medical treatment.</p><h3><strong>What Else are Doctors Doing to Try and Find a Cure?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Additionally, there are Mesothelioma Clinical Trials being performed in numerous hospitals as the medical profession attempts to find a lasting cure for this horrific disease. These matters must be discussed with your medical doctors as the requirements and specifications for the clinical trials are unique and made without any assurance of curing this asbestos related disease.</p><h3><strong>What are the Legal Options for the victim and their family?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">If you or your family member has been diagnosed with Mesothelioma, you should get in touch with a Mesothelioma lawyer as early as possible to determine whether there is a Mesothelioma case and to preserve the right to timely bring a legal action against the responsible corporation. Time can be of the essence both medically and legally.</p><h3><strong>What must be done to help preserve legal rights?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">You want to be sure and document the treatment and care of the loved one including taking photographs and preserving medical records. You want to preserve evidence and establish facts of the asbestos exposure while the victim of asbestos exposure is still alive and able to provide information.</p><h3><strong>What are the Legal Damages?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Damages can include past and future medical bills for the treatment, documented lost wages due to inability to work and economic damages such as loss of insurance or future retirement benefits. Additional damages include pain, suffering, surgical scars and emotional trauma including fear and depression.</p><h3><strong>How can Wallace & Graham help?</strong></h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">At the <strong>Wallace & Graham P.A. </strong>Law Firm the dedicated lawyers and experienced staff will review your case and if appropriate try to expedite the case, as courts tend to give higher priority to Mesothelioma lawsuits where the victim is still alive.

  blog: '<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Miners who suffer from an advanced form of black lung disease has skyrocketed</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The proportion of coal miners who suffer from an advanced form of black lung disease has skyrocketed in central Appalachia in recent years, according to experts with the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health. (NIOSH)</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">In a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://big.assets.huffingtonpost.com/NIOSHletter.pdf\">letter published Monday</a>&nbsp;in the American Journal of Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine, the NIOSH scientists wrote that the prevalence of Progressive Massive Fibrosis, or PMF, a particularly lethal form of black lung, had reached its highest rate since the 1970&apos;s in Kentucky, Virginia and West Virginia.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Coal miners develop black lung disease, or coal workers&apos; pneumoconiosis, through prolonged exposure to the coal dust in a mine&apos;s atmosphere. It&apos;s a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/29/black-lung-disease-kentucky-coal-dust_n_5368878.html\">miserable occupational </a>lung disease that forces miners to live out their last days coughing and gasping for air. Families should not have to go through this preventable tragedy. Witnessing a family member slowly suffocated to death is unconscionable. &nbsp;NIOSH says the disease played a role in an estimated 10,000 deaths over a recent 10-year period.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The tragic comeback could been prevented and the numbers, had the responsible parties acted, should have declined. Instead PMF is at levels not seen since the 1970’s. It is preventable but once a miner has PMF the occupational disease is not curable. At best, according to the American Lung Association, “doctors treat the symptoms and complications of the disease to lessen breathing difficulties”.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">“Each of these cases is a tragedy and represents a failure among all those responsible for preventing this severe disease," wrote David J. Blackley and Cara N. Halldin, officials with NIOSH, a branch of the Centers for Disease Control.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Monday&apos;s letter, PMF was "virtually eradicated" just 15 years ago, but the sample of long-term underground miners from last year showed a nearly ten-fold increase, to 3.23 percent of workers, in the central Appalachian states.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The officials attributed the alarming spike to two likely factors: workers&apos; overexposure to coal dust, with many miners now working longer hours, or an "increased toxicity" in dust composition -- that is, even unhealthier air in today&apos;s mines. They are working longer hours in highly toxic conditions. Seems pretty open and obvious if one is looking to prevent lung disease to its workers.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The study, by researchers at NIOSH, a respected group focused on workers safety, analyzed results from a long-term surveillance program. The program required that miners periodically undergo chest X-rays to help establish a baseline and then track any progression or changes.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The increase in cases of disease reflects the proportion of underground miners with experience of 25 years or more who had X-ray evidence of severe black lung while still working. The disease develops from long-term exposure to coal dust and can lead to shortness of breath, disability and death. Once again all preventable if the companies were to focus 110% effort towards employee safety.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">As it grapples with a resurgence of black lung in many areas, the Labor Department recently announced it is&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/04/23/black-lung-msha-reforms_n_5198423.html\">updating and tightening its black lung regulations</a>&nbsp;for the mining industry. Most notably, the reforms will lower a mine&apos;s allowable level of coal dust from 2.0 milligrams per cubic meter of air to 1.5, a move meant to force operators to better ventilate their mines.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">However industry continues to fight these matters. The senior vice president of the National Mining Association, admits that the industry has been aware of increased black lung in the region and companies were supposed to be taking steps to address the issue. At the same time, however, the National Mining Association filed a lawsuit in federal court in Atlanta in June seeking to block the new safety rules. This appears to be corporate double speak at its best.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The rule changes, if implemented and complied with, will also overhaul how operators must monitor their dust levels. Under the new regulations, miners will be equipped with a personal dust monitor that provides real-time readings of a mine&apos;s coal dust level. Under the old system, miners wore personal dust pumps that sampled the air and were then sent to regulators for analysis.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">For years and years, coal operators have been able to game the system by submitting fraudulent dust samples to regulators, making the air seem less dangerous than it really is. The new dust monitors will likely make it harder for companies to mislead regulators.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The companies monitor themselves and when this occurs corners are cut and data is manipulated. Corporations are driven by profit and focus on safety only when forced to. Even in today’s highly regulated industry workers are seen as production tools and ignored as humans with families to support. Much like a toaster, if it breaks down, throw it out and get a new one.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Experts believe it will take years to slow the prevalence of black lung in Central Appalachia because the long latency period of the disease means other miners already have likely been exposed to unhealthy levels of dust but haven&apos;t been diagnosed. For these miners the proposed regulations will be too late to save them from the misery of the disease.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The attorneys at Wallace & Graham P.A. in Salisbury NC are experienced in handling occupational illness and injury claims and have focused on lung diseases caused by occupational and household exposure. The firm has the resources and knowledge to help miners and their families who have been needlessly and carelessly afflicted with the disease.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The firm is experienced in establishing medical monitoring programs and in successfully documenting the injuries and seeking relief from the responsible corporations who profited from the miners work.</p><p style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>Please feel free to contact Wallace & Graham at 1-800-849-5291 for a free no obligation confidential consultation about your rights and remedies under the law.

  blog: '<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The Social Security Administration’s Disability benefits system is fraught with unclear requirements and a long and confusing application process.&nbsp; This is unfortunate as so many truly disabled workers have spent a working lifetime paying into the system, earning these needed benefits.&nbsp; To make matters worse, there are endless amounts of inaccurate and/or misleading information floating around the web.&nbsp; The purpose of this article is to clear up some of the most common myths about applying for Social Security Disability Insurance (SSDI) benefits.</p><h3>Myth #1:</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">I just became disabled, but since I am almost 62, I can qualify for early Social Security retirement benefits and the benefit amount is about the same so I will just wait.</p><h3>FALSE.</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While it certainly can be a “hassle” to apply for SSDI benefits, the benefit of being awarded SSD versus early retirement far outweighs the hassle, for most.&nbsp; When you elect to take early Social Security retirement benefits at age 62, you get a significantly reduced benefit – <a title="socialsecurity.gov " href=\"https://www.socialsecurity.gov/OACT/quickcalc/early_late.html\">as much as 30% less</a>. That is a substantial amount of money, especially stretched out over one’s life expectancy.&nbsp; The SSDI benefit, however, is essentially your full retirement benefit.&nbsp; Therefore, you if you find yourself in this situation, you should contact an SSDI attorney to discuss your options.</p><h2 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Myth #2:</h3><p>I am disabled due to a work-related injury, so I cannot apply for SSDI.</p><h3>FALSE.</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Even if your disability is work-related and you are receiving workers’ compensation disability benefits from your employer, you should still apply for SSDI in most situations if you believe you are disabled.&nbsp; In North Carolina, if you are receiving workers’ compensation disability benefits, you are likely receiving 66 2/3% of your former weekly wage.&nbsp; If you apply for and receive SSDI benefits, there will likely be an offset, but injured workers can typically get additional benefits through SSDI as you are allowed to receive up to 80% of your average current earnings when combining the SSDI and workers’ compensation benefits.&nbsp; Therefore, if you are currently receiving the 66 2/3% workers’ compensation benefit, qualifying for SSDI could mean you receive an additional benefit from SSDI to bring your combined benefit to 80% of your former wage. [<a title="ssa.gov" href=\"https://www.ssa.gov/OP_Home/handbook/handbook.05/handbook-0504.html#S0504-3\">Source</a>]</p><h3>Myth #3:</h3><p>I am disabled, but don’t want to apply for SSDI because it’s a government handout.</p><h3>FALSE.</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Unfortunately, this is a very common belief, but it couldn’t be further from the truth.&nbsp; You may have noticed that on your paychecks you pay a tax called “FICA” (Federal Insurance Contributions Act).&nbsp; You have likely been paying this ever since you started working.&nbsp; It’s an insurance policy, in essence, and if you become disabled, you get an SSDI benefit in an amount which is determined by how much you have paid into the system throughout your working life.&nbsp; Individuals who have never worked cannot qualify for SSDI benefits because they have not paid FICA taxes throughout their working lives.&nbsp; In other words, this should never be considered a “handout.”&nbsp; Whatever benefits you qualify for, you have earned.</p><h3>Myth #4:</h3><p>I am disabled, but still young, so I cannot qualify for SSDI.</p><h3>FALSE.</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">While it is more difficult to get awarded SSDI benefits at a young age, it is certainly not impossible, and Wallace & Graham has helped a number of clients under the age of 40 get awarded SSDI.</p><h3>Myth #5:</h3><p>I cannot afford a Social Security Disability attorney.</p><h3>FALSE.</h3><p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Our law firm offers free consultations to anyone wanting to discuss their options regarding SSDI.&nbsp; Moreover, the only way your attorney gets paid is if you get awarded SSDI which will be paid directly to your attorney by the Social Security Administration out of your past-due benefits.</p>'

  blog: '<h3>Fraud Alerts</h3><p>Friends, as a consumer lawyer I am frequently shocked by the stories I hear about how far some people will go to cheat others out of money.&nbsp; Some of the worst stories I hear are about those who prey on the elderly.&nbsp; If you have elderly relatives, particularly if they are technologically inexperienced or victims of dementia, be aware that there are criminals out there attempting to prey on them. Many of the old scams that have been around forever – <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2MB2CFB\">sweetheart scams</a>, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Snake_oil\">snake oil</a> salesmen, and overcharging – are finding new ways to use the Internet to succeed.&nbsp; This article addresses a couple of scams that we have seen succeeding to a disturbing degree lately: the “809” scam and the Sweepstakes scam.</p><h3>809, 876, 649, or 284 Scam</h3><h4><strong>How it works</strong></h4><p>The numbers above refer to Caribbean area codes.&nbsp; The scammer uses a variety of techniques to try to get the victim to call a number in one of those area codes.&nbsp; Some call and hang up after one ring, trying to get a curious victim to call back.&nbsp; Some leave a voicemail requesting a call back to one of those numbers.&nbsp; Some try threats or offer prizes, all to try to get the victim to call the number.&nbsp; Then, once the victim calls, the goal is to keep the victim on the line as long as possible. The number the victim is asked to call works like a 1-900 number here in the U.S.&nbsp; If the victim calls the number, the victim&apos;s phone bill will be charged several dollars per minute of the call, some of which ends up in the hands of the scammer.&nbsp; It works because Caribbean phone companies don&apos;t have a separate area code, like 1-900, for pay-per-minute calls... any phone number can be set up to work like a 1-900 number does in the U.S.</p><h3><strong>How to deal with it</strong></h3><p>Call the victim&apos;s phone company and ask them to help you get the charges refunded.&nbsp; They know about these scams and can usually get some of the money back. Also, complain to the FTC.&nbsp; Here’s their <a href=\"https://www.consumer.ftc.gov/Blog/did-you-get-call-area-code-876\">website</a>.&nbsp; The FTC tries to catch these criminals, and the information you provide might help them succeed.</p><h3>Sweepstakes Scam</h3><h3><strong>How it works</strong></h3><p>The victim receives a mailer inviting him or her to send in some small amount of money – usually $5 to $15 – for a chance to win a larger prize of thousands of dollars.&nbsp; Often these mailers come from overseas.&nbsp; Often they use official-looking seals and official-sounding titles to try to seem more credible.&nbsp; Sometimes the victim performs a trivial mathematical task or game that makes the mailer seem more exclusive. Even in the best cases, where there really is a prize that will be given out, these sweepstakes amount to an extremely unfavorable form of gambling.&nbsp; In a typical Vegas game, the “house” take might be somewhere around 5% to 10%.&nbsp; In these games, it’s not uncommon for the “house” to take 80%.&nbsp; If you’re one of our clients in North Carolina, note that gambling is illegal here, making these games especially dishonest. But in the worst cases, the victim will later receive a subsequent mailer stating that he or she has “won!”&nbsp; But in order to claim the prize, the victim must send in some additional amount of money – usually thousands of dollars – to cover “taxes,” “fees,” or “expenses.”&nbsp; The scammers will often call the victim, too, sometimes claiming to be held up at customs and needing the victim to immediately wire funds to pay customs duties.&nbsp; It is not at all uncommon for the scammers to impersonate FBI agents, Homeland Security Agents, SBI agents, or other government officials.&nbsp; The bottom line: <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><strong>if someone asks you to send money so that you can claim a prize, DON’T DO IT</strong>.</span></p><h3><strong>How to deal with it</strong></h3><p>Unfortunately, these people are very good at remaining anonymous, and it is unlikely that victims will be able to recover their money.&nbsp; Above all, alert your elderly family members to the existence of this scam.&nbsp; Don’t condescend; just let them know that you would appreciate it if they would tell you if they’re thinking of entering any contests like this.&nbsp; Be careful not to make them feel embarrassed about participating in such a scam.. If you’ve been defrauded, you can file a complaint Unfortunately, despite the many calls we get about these scams, we are rarely able to file a lawsuit on behalf of the victim, in part because the scammers tend to be foreign nationals with limited assets.&nbsp; If your loved one falls victim to one of these scams, we wish you the best and sincerely hope that government law enforcement can help to recover the lost funds.</p>'

People are taking notice of the political, legislative changes being made in Raleigh that are negatively impacting working-class families. As Eladio Bobadilla notes in his <a href=\"https://www.newsobserver.com/2014/08/12/4067647/industrial-commission-losses-will.html?sp=/99/108/\">article</a>, the NC legislature has taken a “wrecking ball” to the judicial systems designed and maintained by generations of Republicans and Democrats. Most recently, the legislature is passing legislation to allow it to fire all of the 22 career deputy commissioners who have long-heard workers’ compensation cases and who have years of experience and expertise in workers’ compensation law. Changing the law to allow the deputy commissioners to be fired at will, politicizes the application of the Workers’ Compensation Act by causing the deputy commissioners to fear for their job instead of just being able to apply the law and facts to each case to reach the correct legal outcomes. The deputy commissioners now have reason to worry about how their decisions may affect their job. Wallace & Graham is working hard to keep politics out of the application of the Workers’ Compensation Act, and to maintain fairness for injured workers.

  blog: '<h3>Cancer&nbsp;can be&nbsp;Cause&nbsp;by&nbsp;Laparoscopic Hysterectomies</h3><p>The Food and Drug Administration has recently&nbsp;warned of the possibility of cancer&nbsp;being spread in a woman’s bottom during a laparoscopic hysterectomy. Each year, a half a million women in the United States undergo hysterectomies.&nbsp; These are normally done due to “fibroids” which are benign growths in the uterus that can cause pain, bleeding and other symptoms.&nbsp; These are normally noncancerous, however, occasionally, some cancerous cells may be hidden in the fibroid.&nbsp; The FDA estimates that one in <a href=\"https://www.webmd.com/women/News/20140417/fda-warns-against-procedure-for-uterine-fibroids\">350 women will have these hidden cancers</a>. Historically, hysterectomies have been done as an open abdominal procedure.&nbsp;&nbsp; The surgeon merely opens the abdomen and the uterus is removed.&nbsp; In recent years, however, laparoscopic hysterectomies have become more common.&nbsp;&nbsp; In this procedure, a small tube is inserted into the abdomen and a tool known as a power morcellator is inserted.&nbsp; The morcellator grinds the fibroids and the uterus into small fragments which are then removed. The problem that occurs is when the fibroid contains hidden cancer cells.&nbsp; If the hysterectomy is a traditional method, the whole uterus is removed and the cancer cells are all removed.&nbsp; However, <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">if the&nbsp;morcellator is used</span>, the fibroid is ground into fragments.&nbsp;&nbsp; The fragments that contain cancer cells are then spread onto surrounding tissue and the <strong>cancer</strong> is therefore spread. The medical community has recently become aware of the cancer risks associated with cancer spread during laparoscopic hysterectomies when a morcellator is used.&nbsp; In April of 2014, the FDA announced that there is no way to guarantee that these procedures will not spread cancer.&nbsp; The FDA has advised that women undergoing this procedure should be advised of the risks of cancer. Therefore, women who have undergone laparoscopic surgery and the surgeon used power morcellation, there is a risk that the procedure may have spread cancerous tissue to the abdomen and the pelvis. Approximately 60,000 of these procedures are done in the United States every year.&nbsp; If you are scheduled to have such a laparoscopic hysterectomy, you should ask if power morcellation will be used.&nbsp; If so, you should understand the risks associated with the procedure. If you have undergone the procedure and have not been diagnosed with cancer, it is unlikely that you will develop a later cancer as normally, when the tissue is removed, some of it is tested for cancer. If you have undergone such a procedure and have developed cancer, please call our firm at&nbsp;<a href=\"tel:7046335244" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:7046335244\">704.633.5244</a>&nbsp;/&nbsp;<a href=\"tel:800.849.5291" data-cke-saved-href=\"tel:800.849.5291\">800.849.5291</a>&nbsp;to discuss your rights.</p>'

  tag: 'Work-Related Injuries',
  blog: '<h2 style=\"text-align: center;\">10 Important Steps</h3><p>Many workers feel worried and overwhelmed when they suffer an injury on the job.&nbsp; They do not want to lose their jobs.&nbsp; They are hurting due to their injury or disease.&nbsp; They are confused about exactly what benefits they are entitled to under the <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute.htm\">North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act</a>.&nbsp; The following is a list is of very important initial steps to take when you have been injured. 1.<strong> Report your Injury</strong>. You should report your injury as soon as it occurs to your supervisor. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Report the injury orally and in writing</span>. Even if you are not yet sure whether the injury is a serious one, it is always best to report the injury. Your notice should include your name, address, time, place, nature, and cause of the accident. If you do not report your injury to your supervisor within 30 days of it occurring, your employer may argue that it did not have proper “notice” of the claim. See <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-22.htm" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">N.C. Gen. Stat. § 97-22</a>. Your employer wants the opportunity to timely investigate your claim to determine if they deem the injury to be work-related. 2.<strong> Request medical treatment or second opinion, if needed</strong>. Once you realize your need for medical treatment, you should ask your employer to set up a visit with a physician. Your insurance adjuster has the initial right to direct your medical treatment to the facility/doctor of their choice. However, if that doctor at some point thinks you need a specialist to address your unique injury or disease, that doctor can refer you to a certain doctor, type of doctor, or facility for an examination. You are entitled to second opinion examination(s) with a doctor of your choosing for a second opinion on a permanent disability rating (<a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-27.htm" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">N.C. Gen. Stat. § 97-27(b)</a>) and a doctor of your and the insurance adjuster’s mutual choosing for additional treatment options (<a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-25.htm" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">N.C. Gen. Stat. § 97-25(b) and (c)</a>). You can also ask that the Industrial Commission approve a doctor of your choosing for ongoing treatment. Your medical treatment and second opinion rights can often be confusing. Ask a workers’ compensation attorney for help or advice if you have trouble receiving the medical treatment or second opinions you need. 3. <strong>File legal notice of your claim with the North Carolina Industrial Commission.</strong> You are required to file legal notice of your injury/disease with the Industrial Commission within two years of when the disabling injury occurred, was diagnosed, or was linked to your employment by a competent medical authority. The Industrial Commission created a form called a<a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/forms/form18esV1.34.pdf" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\"> Form 18</a> so employees can easily accomplish this. The Form 18 includes detailed filing instructions at the bottom of the <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/forms/form18a.pdf" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">form</a>. 4. <strong>Communicate with the right person</strong>. Many workers continue to communicate with their supervisor, human resources (HR) representative, or company nurse after an injury. In many cases, that is not the appropriate person to have ongoing communications with regarding your work injury. All employers with 3 or more regular employees are required by state law to carry workers’ compensation insurance. See <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-2.htm" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">N.C. Gen. Stat. § 97-2</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-93.htm" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">§ 97-93</a>, <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-94.htm" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">§ 97-94</a>. You should ask your employer to provide you the name and number of its workers’ compensation insurance carrier. If the company is self-insured, you should ask for the insurance representative. If your employer neglects to provide you the insurance carrier information, the North Carolina Industrial Commission provides a free database, called the <a href=\"https://ccms.ic.nc.gov/insurancecoverage/inscov/insCoverageSearch" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">Insurance Coverage Search System</a>, where you can look up which carrier insures your employer. Once you have found the insurance carrier, you should call them and give them your name and SSN and ask to speak to the insurance adjuster assigned to your claim. If your calls go unanswered, we encourage workers to ask for their insurance adjuster’s email address and to put any unanswered requests in writing. 5. <strong>Wait for a determination on whether your claim is accepted or denied.</strong> The North Carolina Workers’ Compensation Act in<a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-18.htm" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\"> § 97-18</a> provides your employer and its insurance carrier a reasonable amount of time to determine whether to accept or deny a claim. The Industrial Commission recommends that within 30 days after your employer has notice of the injury it should accept the claim and/or deny the claim. If you have not received a response from your insurance adjuster within 90 days (3 months) after you gave notice of injury despite your follow-ups, you should consider hiring an attorney. If you learn that your claim has been denied, the employer or insurance adjuster must submit a written explanation describing why your claim has been denied. If you do not understand the reason for denial, you should contact a <a href=\"workers-compensation-injury-claims\">workers’ compensation attorney</a> who can explain the law given your injury or disease case facts. An attorney may be willing to represent you and fight for your right to workers’ compensation benefits. 6. <strong>Consider whether to give a recorded statement.</strong> During your employer/insurance adjuster’s investigation period, they may ask that you give a recorded statement. You can only be recorded with your consent. Your insurance adjuster plans to ask you questions to determine whether they will accept or deny your injury. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Not all injuries that happen at work are compensable</span>. Your answers to the insurance adjuster’s questions will be recorded and transcribed. If you have questions about whether your injury is a compensable one, you should contact a workers’ compensation attorney. 7. <strong>Request benefits for time out of work.</strong> If your claim is accepted and you have missed work due to your injury, you are entitled to weekly benefits while you are out of work. (See <strong>Step 8</strong> below to determine the amount of your weekly benefit.) There is a 7 day waiting period until your benefits will start. (You can use paid sick leave, vacation, annual leave, or disability benefits during the first 7 days out of work.) After you have missed 7 days of work, whether consecutive or not, you should start receiving weekly checks. If you miss more than 21 days of work, you are entitled to a weekly check for the first 7 days missed. See <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-28.htm" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">N.C. Gen. Stat. § 97-28</a>. There are different compensation rules that apply if you have returned to work with your employer or a different employer and are earning less money weekly than you earned before your injury. If you have more detailed questions about your entitlement to weekly benefits, ask a workers’ compensation attorney. 8. <strong>Determine your correct weekly workers’ compensation rate.</strong> If you are out of work due to your injury, you are generally entitled to 2/3rds of your average weekly wage for the 52 weeks preceding your injury. See <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/ncic/pages/statute/97-2.htm" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">N.C. Gen. Stat. § 97-2(5)</a>. For example, if you made $500.00 per week including overtime, your workers’ compensation rate would be $333.35. ($500 x .6667 = $333.35) Your average weekly wage should include your overtime and per diem pay. <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Request yourt insurance adjuster provide you a completed <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/forms/form22.pdf" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\"><em>Form 22</em></a> to make sure you are being paid the correct workers’ compensation rate.</span> If you have returned to work with your employer or a different employer and are earning less money weekly than you earned before your injury, you are entitled to 2/3rds the difference between your average weekly wages pre-injury versus post-injury. If you have questions or concerns about your workers’ compensation rate(s), contact a workers’ compensation attorney. 9. <strong>Request a complete copy of your medical records.</strong> Other than providing for your family, the most important thing during this time is your medical recovery. Your goal is to get all the treatment that doctors think is necessary to cure or provide relief to your condition. Many times, when workers are in a medical visit, they are not taking notes and sometimes forget many things the doctor says, including the exact work restrictions or diagnoses. Workers can request a copy of their medical records from their insurance adjuster or from the health care provider itself. It may be helpful to review your own medical records so you have an in depth understanding of what your condition is, your timeline for recovery, and what type of medical treatment your doctor thinks you may need down the road. 10.<strong> Be willing to contact the IC and/or an attorney for advice or, if necessary, representation.</strong> In 10 steps, it is impossible to articulate all the complexities of the NC Workers’ Compensation Act or to explain what benefits you may be entitled to as a result of your work injury. Before accepting any settlement of benefits, be sure to talk to someone knowledgeable about the workers’ compensation system. <a href=\"https://www.ic.nc.gov/index.html" target=\"_blank\" rel="noopener noreferrer\\">The North Carolina Industrial Commission</a> has a hotline available to injured workers – (800) 988-8349 – and our firm, <a href=\"tel:7046335244\">704.633.5244</a> / <a href=\"tel:800.849.5291\">800.849.5291</a> is always willing to answer questions.</p>'

  blog: '<p>North Carolina laws set <strong>very important deadlines for filing your personal injury lawsuit</strong>. These deadlines are known in Court as the “<a href=\"https://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByArticle/Chapter_1/Article_5.pdf\">statute of limitations</a>” laws.&nbsp; They are called that because they limit how much time you have to sue.&nbsp; After the legally allowed period for you to sue has expired, you as the injured person may lose the right to file a lawsuit to recover monetary damages or other relief, unless a legal exception applies. A statute of limitations is said to start running at the time a claim “accrues.” Typically, that is the time at which the injury occurs. There are a number of different statutes which apply a limitations period and they can vary from State to State.&nbsp; Thus, it’s important to consult with a qualified North Carolina personal injury attorney to determine which statute applies and preserve you right to recover damages. Often, the facts of how someone is injured involve more than one State.&nbsp; For example, you might have your home in North Carolina, but you go on a road trip into Virginia.&nbsp; If you get in a car wreck while you’re in Virginia, which statute of limitations should apply – the one for North Carolina or the one for Virginia?&nbsp; These kinds of issues can get complicated pretty quickly which is all the more reason to contact a lawyer so that you as the injured victim can know your rights. To make matters more complicated, there are also special laws called “statutes of repose” that may also apply.&nbsp; A statute of repose can set another time limit on when to bring a claim. In North Carolina, our legislature has determined that the following time limits generally apply to bringing certain claims in court. Keep in mind that it may be possible to bring multiple claims arising from a single incident. Also, there may be an exception to the standard limitations period that applies to a specific situation. &nbsp;Accordingly this list is for general guidance only and it is important to consult with an attorney.&nbsp; Below are a few examples of statutory periods in North Carolina:</p><ul class="list"><li><strong>Personal Injury: </strong>Negligence claims must be brought within three years of the date when the bodily harm was or should have been apparent. However, all negligence claims must be commenced within ten years after the date of the act giving rise to the injury.&nbsp; This law is found in North Carolina General Statute Section 1-52, abbreviated as <a href=\"https://www.ncleg.net/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_1/GS_1-52.html\"><strong>N.C.G.S. § 1-52</strong></a><strong>.&nbsp; </strong>An example of a personal injury claim might be if you or a loved one gets in a motor vehicle accident and is injured.</li></ul><ul class="list"><li><strong>Professional Malpractice:</strong> &nbsp;Generally the victim of malpractice has three years to sue but this might be extended to a longer time depending on the facts.&nbsp; For example, if the injury was something that was not readily apparent when it happened, the victim may have some extra time to sue after he discovers the injury.&nbsp; But the amount of extra time may be limited. The statute for malpractice claims is very complicated and you should consult an attorney to see how they apply to you. &nbsp;The statute is <a href=\"https://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_1/GS_1-15.html\">N.C.G.S. § 1-15.</a>&nbsp;An example of a malpractice claim would be if you went to a hospital for a surgery, and you were injured because of medical malpractice.</li><li><strong>Defamation/Libel/Slander: </strong>Oneyear. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_1/GS_1-54.html\">N.C.G.S. § 1-54</a>.&nbsp; An example of a defamation claim would be if a newspaper printed that somebody was a mass murderer when in fact they were never charged with a crime and never did such a thing.</li><li><strong>Trespass: </strong>Three years. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_1/GS_1-52.html\">N.C.G.S. § 1-52(3)</a>.&nbsp; An example of a trespass might be if some neighbors cut down trees in the woods on your property and put down a dirt bike trail.&nbsp; Sometimes if a trespass comes and goes, or happens, then stops, then happens again, a new time period to sue begins each time.</li><li><strong>Products Liability:</strong> A lawsuit for negligence for a product defect must be brought within three years of the injury or loss, and a claim for breach of contract must be filed within three years of the breach. Additionally, a product liability lawsuit must also comply with the twelve year statute of repose, meaning that the suit may have to be brought within twelve years of the product’s initial purchase, unless an exception applies or the matter does not fall within the scope of the statute. <a href=\"https://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/PDF/ByChapter/Chapter_99B.pdf\">N.C.G.S § 99B</a>, § 1-46.1, § 1-52.&nbsp; An example of a product liability claim might be if someone was injured in an airplane crash and the airplane crashed because of a manufacturing defect in its engine.</li><li><strong>Injury to Personal Property:</strong> Three years. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_1/GS_1-52.html\">N.C.G.S. § 1-52(4)</a>.&nbsp; An example might be if you owned a forklift, and someone came and took out an engine part so that now you could not use it.</li><li><strong>Fraud:</strong> Three years.&nbsp; The time may be extended if the fraud took a while to be discovered. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_1/GS_1-52.html\">N.C.G.S. § 1-52(9)</a>.</li><li><strong>Contracts:</strong> Three years.&nbsp; The three year period may begin to run when the contract is breached. However, sometimes language inside of the contract itself can shorten or lengthen the time. &nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.ncga.state.nc.us/EnactedLegislation/Statutes/HTML/BySection/Chapter_1/GS_1-52.html\">N.C.G.S. § 1-52(1)</a>.&nbsp; An example would be if Joe agreed to pay Sam $50 a month to buy his boat, but then stopped paying midway through the contract.</li><li><strong>Wrongful death</strong>:&nbsp; Two years.&nbsp; N.C.G.S. § 1-53.</li></ul><p>There are many other legal rules that can affect the time period you have to bring a claim.&nbsp; For example, a victim of the asbestos-related disease of mesothelioma may not learn that they have the disease until years after they worked around asbestos.&nbsp; The victim also may not even have known that there was dangerous asbestos where they worked.&nbsp; Therefore, in North Carolina, like in many other States, the Courts have allowed victims to sue after they learned of their disease. Sometimes, the law will provide for extra time if you were a minor child when the harm happened.&nbsp; Sometimes, the law provides for extra time if the victim did not know at first that they were injured.&nbsp; There are many other wrinkles in the law. <strong>The bottom line is that if you believe that you have been injured or your legal rights have been violated and that you have a claim, you should act promptly to protect your rights.&nbsp;</strong> It is important to speak with an experienced personal injury attorney as soon as your personal injury occurs.

  blog: '<p>Diesel engine exhaust has now been definitively linked to causing cancer in humans. A panel of experts working for the World Health Organization (WHO) concluded in June 2012 that diesel exhausts is a potential cause of lung cancer. Diesel exhaust has also been linked to pancreatic and bladder cancer. After a week-long meeting of international experts, the International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC), a part of the World Health Organization (WHO), classified diesel engine exhaust as carcinogenic to humans (Group 1), based on sufficient evidence that exposure is associated with an increased risk for lung cancer. WHO based its findings on research in high-risk workers including railway workers and others industrial workers exposed to diesel exhaust. Similarly, American scientists have also found an increased risk of developing lung cancer in workers exposed to diesel fuel exhaust. A recent study found evidence that diesel exhaust exposure supports it as a cause of lung cancer in industrial workers and represent a potential public health burden. See<a href=\"https://www.oxfordjournals.org/our_journals/jnci/press_releases/silvermandjs034.pdf\"> The Diesel Exhaust in Miners</a> study by Debra T. Silverman, et al., JNCI, Journal of the National Cancer Institute, Vol. 104, Issue 11, June 6, 2012. This is very disturbing for the industrial worker as most industries operate a significant amount of diesel powered equipment without providing adequate safety measures for those exposed. Diesel exhaust exposure places the worker at risk for cancer. This risk has been studied and known for years yet many industries have simply ignored the risk and not instituted safety measure or discontinued use of diesel equipment in favor of equipment with safe levels of emission.</p><p>For decades, industry has relied upon diesel engines as a “cheaper” alternative to gasoline powered vehicles and ports, railroad yards and powerhouse industries have widely used heavily polluting diesel engines in its trucks, cranes, ships, trains and other equipment. In the process, industry needlessly over-exposed countless workers, drivers, mechanics, conductors, engineers and others to cancer causing pollution in doses sufficient to cause cancer and in doses that are much greater than the public exposure. All workers with a history of such diesel exhaust exposures who have contracted cancer should look closely at their potential rights.If you have been exposed to diesel exhaust at your current or previous industrial job and have developed lung, pancreatic or bladder cancer you may be <a href=\"workers-compensation-injury-claims\">entitled to compensation</a>. Even if you were or are a smoker, your lung, pancreatic and/or bladder cancer may still be related to your exposure to diesel fuel exhaust. <a href=\"mona-lisa-wallace/\">Please call us</a> for a confidential no obligation and no cost initial consultation to determine you or your family member’s rights.</p>'
