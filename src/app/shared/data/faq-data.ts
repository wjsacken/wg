    question:'What is arbitration?',
    answer: '<p>Arbitration works like this: let&apos;s say your bank overcharges you $500.&nbsp; If you have an&nbsp;arbitration contract, then you&nbsp;cannot sue and have your claim decided by a jury.&nbsp; Instead, your claim will be heard by a single individual who will decide all issues of fact and law.&nbsp;</p><p>Consumer rights advocates have claimed that often the arbitration agencies and arbitrators can be biased because they receive so much of their business from big companies.&nbsp; Also, if the claim is for a small amount of money, it may cost more money to arbitrate the claim than the claim is worth.</p><p>Other problems that people have pointed out with arbitration include:</p><p>You have no jury in an arbitration.&nbsp; The fate of your claim rests only with an arbitrator, and not with a jury of local citizens</p><p>The arbitrator may have a concern that if he rules against the company, the company may not hire the arbitrator for more cases in the future.&nbsp; Often it is the company who pays the arbitrator for his time.</p><p>The company may have a lawyer to help it, but you may not be able to afford a lawyer if your claim is small</p><p>The arbitrator&apos;s decision may not be explained or published.&nbsp;</p><p>The arbitrator’s decision may only be overturned by the court if you can go to the time and expense of proving extreme misconduct on his part.&nbsp;</p><p>Depending on the terms of the particular arbitration clause, there could be a risk that you may have to pay the arbitrator and the corporation&apos;s attorneys.&nbsp;</p><p><em>See also this&nbsp;</em><a href="https://www.businessweek.com/magazine/content/08_24/b4088072611398.htm"><em>article</em></a><em>&nbsp;in Bloomberg Businessweek.</em></p><p>In addition, virtually all arbitration clauses also include a ban on bringing or participating in any form of&nbsp;class action.&nbsp; In the above example, it might be possible for you to get legal representation if you could show that many, many other people were also overcharged - the sum of all your claims together would be enough to warrant hiring an&nbsp;attorney.&nbsp; Arbitration clauses with class bans take away this option,&nbsp;forcing individual customers who have been wronged&nbsp;to&nbsp;face&nbsp;behemoth companies alone.</p><p>Often, customers never even know these provisions exist because they do not read the agreements.&nbsp; Customers are&nbsp;rarely asked to agree to all terms before opening their accounts, and the arbitration agreements are mailed later.&nbsp;</p><p>Most people who do take the time to&nbsp;read their contracts&nbsp;lack the legal knowledge necessary to truly understand how arbitration works and what they are giving up.&nbsp; Even attorneys&nbsp;with full knowledge of these clauses often agree to them, simply because they have no other choice.&nbsp;&nbsp;Bank accounts, credit cards, and mobile phones are necessary in today&apos;s world, and you cannot get any of those without signing on the line and agreeing to the terms presented.</p><p>Also, many times a person may agree to a contract by clicking a button on an internet website.&nbsp; By clicking the button they have agreed to be bound by a long list of terms and conditions that they have never read.&nbsp; This could include an arbitration clause.</p>',

    answer: '<p style="margin: 0in; margin-bottom: .0001pt; vertical-align: baseline;"><span style="color: #333334; letter-spacing: .15pt;">Silica is a mineral. It is normally found&nbsp;within&nbsp;sand and rock. Silica dust is a common byproduct of construction&nbsp;activity and may be inhaled. Exposure to silica dust is considered hazardous to human health. It is estimated that&nbsp;millions of workers in the United States have been exposed to silica dust. Silica dust can be created by any activity that breaks rocks, concrete, or any other material that contains silica. Silicosis is a lung disease caused by exposure to tiny particles of dust which can get into the lungs. This disease often strikes workers exposed to silica. Silicosis is caused by inhaling silica dust. The lungs are injured by inhaled silica dust resulting in the formation of scar tissue. The lungs will react to long-term exposure to silica by developing scarring. This scarring can lead to a dangerous condition in which&nbsp;it&nbsp;becomes hard to breathe. People suffering from silicosis are also at increased risk of other diseases, such as bronchitis and lung cancer. Working in a dusty environment where silica is present can increase a person&apos;s chances of getting silicosis and cancer. Silicosis can occur very slowly and may not be detected by a doctor until decades after the worker’s first exposure to the dust. Some of the symptoms of silica exposure can include shortness of breath, fatigue, chest pain, and cough and flu-like symptoms. A trained physician may be able to detect and diagnose silicosis through performing a chest x-ray.</span></p>',

    question:'What is coal tar pitch and what disease does it cause?',
    answer: '<p>“Coal tar” or “coal tar pitch” is a substance commonly found in many industries that can cause serious health problems.&nbsp; Wallace &amp;&nbsp;Graham has extensive experience in handling coal tar pitch claims having filed numerous claims before the N.C. Industrial Commission and in civil courts around the U.S.&nbsp;&nbsp; Many of these involved workers at the Alcoa facilities across the U.S. and in the steel industry.</p><p><a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3010/pdf/fs2011-3010.pdf">Coal tar&nbsp;</a>“is a thick, black or brown liquid that is a byproduct of the carbonization of coal for the steel industry or the gasification of coal to make coal gas. Coal tar is a byproduct of the coking of coal for the steel industry and coal-tar pitch is the residue remaining after the distillation of coal tar.”&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is coal tar pitch used for, and in which industries?</strong></p><p>Coal tar is often used in roofing and paving.&nbsp; “<a href="https://monographs.iarc.fr/ENG/Monographs/vol100F/mono100F-17.pdf">The exposures associated</a>&nbsp;with roofing are the result of two operations. First, the old roof is removed by cutting, prying and scraping the existing material from the roof, and discarding it. A new roof is then installed by melting solid blocks of coal-tar pitch, pumping or carrying buckets of the molten material to the roof, where layers of roofing felt and liquid coal-tar pitch are spread upon the surface to produce a cover (NIOSH, 2000; IPCS, 2004). Roofers are primarily exposed to PAHs. Other exposures include diesel exhaust, asbestos&nbsp;and&nbsp;organic solvents.” &nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>With regard to paving operations, “<a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3010/pdf/fs2011-3010.pdf">[c]oal-tar-based&nbsp;sealcoat</a>&nbsp;products typically are 20 to 35 percent coal-tar pitch. Product analyses indicate that coal-tar-based&nbsp;sealcoat&nbsp;products contain about 1,000 times more PAHs than&nbsp;sealcoat&nbsp;products with an asphalt base (City of Austin, 2005).” &nbsp;</p><p>Coal tar pitch also plays a prominent role in the aluminum manufacturing process.&nbsp; Aluminum is produced by reducing alumina into molten aluminum through electrolysis.&nbsp; This electrolysis process occurs in reduction cells, called pots, where alumina reacts with carbon anodes producing carbon dioxide and aluminum.&nbsp;</p><p>The&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anode">anode</a>&nbsp;(or positive electrode) is a large block of carbon made from coke and coal tar pitch.&nbsp; It is inserted in a steel box lined with carbon blocks made from metallurgical coke and coal tar pitch.&nbsp; The lining of the pot is called the&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cathode">cathode</a>&nbsp;(or negative electrode).&nbsp; The pots use multiple anodes during electrolysis because the anodes are consumed and must be continuously replaced.&nbsp; During electrolysis, the high temperatures applied to the anodes and cathodes result in the emission of coal tar pitch volatiles in the form of&nbsp;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polycyclic_aromatic_hydrocarbon">polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons</a>&nbsp;(PAHs).&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Workers in steel manufacturing, aluminum manufacturing, roofing, and paving industries are some of those most at risk of being exposed to&nbsp;coal tar pitch.&nbsp;For a free&nbsp;consultation call&nbsp;<a href="tel:800.849.5291">800.849.5291</a>&nbsp;or&nbsp;<a href="mailto:cs@wallacegraham.com?subject=Coal%20Tar%20Pitch%20Website%20Visitor&amp;body=Name%3A%20%0APhone%3A%20%0AEmail%3A%20%0ABest%20time%20to%20contact%20you%3A%20%0A">email us</a>, today!&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What types of cancer does coal tar pitch exposure cause? </strong></p><p><a href="https://pubs.usgs.gov/fs/2011/3010/pdf/fs2011-3010.pdf">Coal-tar pitch contains</a>&nbsp;“50 percent or more polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) by weight and is known to cause cancer in humans (International Agency for Research on Cancer, 1980).”&nbsp; The types of cancer&nbsp;include:&nbsp;&nbsp;lung cancer,&nbsp;bladder cancer,&nbsp;skin cancer&nbsp;(non-melanoma), laryngeal cancer, and&nbsp;kidney cancer.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What is W&amp;G’s experience with coal tar pitch litigation? </strong></p><p>Wallace &amp; Graham has represented many working people who were exposed to coal tar pitch.&nbsp; W&amp;G has litigated a number of claims before the North Carolina Industrial Commission and in civil court.&nbsp;</p>',

    question:'<p>What is a class action?</p>',
    answer: '<p>For a class action to be brought, the law requires that all of the affected individuals have similar claims. For example, where the unfair and deceptive practices of a company affect a large number of consumers the same way, those practices might give rise to a class action.</p><p>Not every person in the “class” has to actually be listed in the lawsuit when it begins. The law allows class actions to be brought by one or more “class representatives” on behalf of the many other class members.</p><p>The plaintiffs in a class action are known as “named plaintiffs” or “class representatives,” and they file a lawsuit on behalf of a larger class of people.</p><p>Consumer class actions may be filed, where appropriate, to recover damages for people who have been harmed in similar ways by product manufacturers, predatory lenders, or other kinds of defendants.</p><h4><a href="class-actions-consumer-rights#collapseThree_2">The requirements for a class action include the following: </a></h4><ul><li>The number of victims must be so numerous that a class action makes more sense than having each person file an individual claim.</li><li>There must be common issues regarding all of the victims in the class.</li><li>The claims of the named plaintiffs (aka the “class representatives”) must be like the claims of other affected victims; their claims must be typical of those of other people.</li><li>The class representatives must be able to fairly and properly represent the class.

If an affected individual receives a notice and decides to opt out, this means that he or she will not be bound by any judgment or settlement of the class action, and he or she may have the ability to bring his or her own claim for damages.</p>',

    question:'What is Mesothelioma?',
    answer: '<p>Mesothelioma is a rare cancer which may affect the lining of the lings (pleura) or the abdominal contents (peritoneum). Most mesotheliomas are caused by exposure to asbestos. As a matter of fact, In the United States, there is no other known proven cause of mesothelioma other than asbestos. Tumors of the mesothelium can be either benign (non-cancerous) or malignant (cancerous).</p><p>Since malignant mesothelioma is much more common than benign mesothelioma it is often simply called mesothelioma. Characteristics of a malignant tumor include the ability to spread to other parts of the body, making it much more dangerous.</p><p>Approximately three-fourths of mesothelioma cases start in the chest cavity and are known as pleural mesothelioma. Another 10% to 20% begin in the abdomen and are called peritoneal mesothelioma. Those starting in the cavity around the heart, or pericardial mesothelioma, are very rare. The covering layer of the testicles is an outpouching of peritoneum into the scrotum. Mesothelioma that affects this covering of the testicles is quite uncommon.</p><p>Mesothelioma is still rare. There are about 2,000 to 3,000 new cases per year in the United States. Most of the people who are diagnosed with malignant mesothelioma are over fifty years old and is seen more often with people in their seventies, since they were exposed to asbestos in the 1940s-50s or earlier. Those who were exposed to asbestos in the 1960s-70s may be diagnosed in years to come. The disease attacks men 3 to 5 times more than women. Men are more likely than women to get this disease because men held more construction positions than women in past decades (before the women&apos;s rights movement had taken place).</p><p>Mesothelioma is also more common to Caucasians than in African Americans. Even though this disease is rare it is very serious. By the time it is diagnosed it is often in its advanced stages, making the outlook not as good as it is for other cancers that are found earlier. The average survival time is about 1 to 2 years after being diagnosed. Of course, survival rates are increasing due to advances in medical technology and new treatments that are being developed for mesothelioma.</p><p>Mesothelioma has been diagnosed in asbestos workers, family members, and residents who live close to asbestos mines.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Treatment of mesothelioma may vary depending on the type, its aggressiveness and other factors. However, a combination of surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy is used in most cases.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.mesothelioma.com/treatment/cancer-centers/duke-cancer-institute.htm">Duke University Medical Center</a>&nbsp;in Durham North Carolina is a leading Medical Center helping victims of this disease caused by asbestos exposure.</p>',
